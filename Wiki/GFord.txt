'''Gerald Rudolph''' "'''Jerry'''" '''Ford, Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King, Jr.'''; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|38th]] [[President of the United States]], serving from 1974 to 1977, and, prior to this, was the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|40th]] [[Vice President of the United States]] serving from 1973 to 1974 under President [[Richard Nixon]].  He was the first person appointed to the Vice Presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], after [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned. When he became president upon [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] resignation on August 9, 1974, he became the first and to date only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Before ascending to the Vice Presidency, Ford served nearly 25 years as the [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], eight of them as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]].

As President, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], marking a move toward [[détente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the [[Fall of Saigon|conquest of South Vietnam]] by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973–1975|ended]].  Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the [[Great Depression]], with growing inflation and a [[recession]] during his tenure.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= xxiii, 301}}</ref> One of his more controversial acts was to grant a [[presidential pardon]] to President Richard Nixon for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. During Ford's incumbency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President.<!-- (Please keep hidden until fully developed below) "This was made clear by developments in two major substantive issues during Ford's presidency: the Cyprus crisis and Arab Israeli relations." --><ref name="Lenczowski">{{cite book|author=[[George Lenczowski]]|title=American Presidents, and the Middle East|year=1990|isbn=0-8223-0972-6|pages=142–143|publisher=Duke University Press}}</ref> In 1976, Ford defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination, but narrowly lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election]] to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Carter]].

Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party.  After experiencing health problems, Ford [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died in his home]] on December 26, 2006. Ford [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|lived longer than any other U.S. president]], living 93 years and 165 days, while his [[List of Presidents of the United States by time in office|895-day presidency]] remains the shortest of all presidents who did not die in office.

==Early life==
Gerald Ford was born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner Ford|Dorothy Ayer Gardner]], and his father was [[Leslie Lynch King, Sr.]], a wool trader and a son of prominent banker [[Charles Henry King]] and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the [[Oak Park, Illinois]] home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913; she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Jeff C.|title=The Fathers of American Presidents|year=1997|isbn=0-7864-0182-6|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, NC}}</ref>
[[File:Gerald Ford 1916.gif|left|thumb|upright|alt=A young boy circa 1916.|Leslie Lynch King, Jr. (later known as Gerald R. Ford) in 1916]]

Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother.<ref name="ford-Nebraska">{{cite news|title=Nebraska-born Ford Left State as Infant|author=Funk, Josh|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=December 27, 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0,4670,FordNebraska,00.html|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref> James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a Ford biography that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.<ref name="pbs-knife">{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=James |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R. Ford |work=Character Above All|publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref>

After two and a half years with her parents, on February 1, 1916, Dorothy married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]], a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They then called her son ''Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr.'' The future president was never formally [[adoption|adopted]], however, and he did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.<ref name="utexas">{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/genealog.asp|title=Gerald R. Ford Genealogical Information |work=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum |publisher=University of Texas |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref> He was raised in [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] with his three half brothers from his mother's second marriage: [[Thomas Gardner Ford]] (1918–1995), Richard Addison Ford (born 1924), and James Francis Ford (1927–2001).

Ford also had three half-siblings from his father's second marriage: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (born 1925). They never saw one another as children and he did not know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his father Leslie King, whom Ford described as a "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two "maintained a sporadic contact" until Leslie King, Sr.'s death.<ref name="ford-Nebraska"/><ref>{{cite news |title=A Common Man on an Uncommon Climb|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1976|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=F10F10FF3E5D14768FDDA00994D0405B868BF1D3|page=28|accessdate=April 26, 2009 | format=PDF}}</ref>

Ford maintained his distance emotionally, saying, "My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing."<ref name="kunhardt">{{cite book |last=Kunhardt, Jr. |first=Phillip |url=http://www.americanpresident.org/history/geraldford/biography/resources/ArticlesCopy1/KunhardtFordBio.article.shtml |title=Gerald R.

Ford was involved in The [[Boy Scouts of America]], and earned that program's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="honor">{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |url=http://us.macmillan.com/legacyofhonor|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=12–13 and 87|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=December 29, 2006 |year=2007 |origyear= December 26, 2006}}</ref> In later years, Ford received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] in May 1970 and [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America. He is the only U.S. president to have been an Eagle Scout.<ref name="honor"/> [[Scouting]] was so important to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum. A few selected scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ray |first=Mark |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0703/a-ford.html |title=Eagle Scout Welcome Gerald Ford Home |work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 5, 2007}}</ref>

Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School and was a star athlete and [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his [[American football|football]] team.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Investigatory Records on Gerald Ford, Applicant for a Commission|date=December 30, 1941|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0069/2825430.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]]. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.<ref name="kunhardt"/>

Attending the [[University of Michigan]] as an undergraduate, Ford played [[center (American football)|center]] and [[linebacker]] for the school's football team<ref>{{cite news|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Special Report: Former President Gerald Ford Dies; Sought to Heal Nation Disillusioned by Watergate Scandal|date=December 27, 2006|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529638|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}</ref> and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] to undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national titles]] in [[1932 Michigan Wolverines football team|1932]] and [[1933 Michigan Wolverines football team|1933]]. The team suffered a steep decline in his [[1934 Michigan Wolverines football team|1934]] senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless, and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] later said, "When I walked into the dressing room at half time, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." Ford later recalled, "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause."<ref name="perry">{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Will |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202h.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football|chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=150–152 |publisher=The Strode Publishers |location=Huntsville, Alabama|isbn=0-87397-055-1|accessdate=December 28, 2006 |year=1974}}</ref>

During Ford's senior year a controversy developed when the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] refused to play a scheduled game if a black player named [[Willis Ward]] took the field. Even after protests from students, players and alumni, university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team and they [[Roommate|roomed]] together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university’s decision, but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.<ref>{{cite news | first = Brian | last = Kruger | first2 = Buddy | last2 = Moorehouse | title = Willis Ward, Gerald Ford and Michigan Football's darkest day | date = August 9, 2012 | url = http://blogs.detroitnews.com/history/2012/08/09/willis-ward-gerald-ford-and-michigan-footballs-darkest-day/ | work = The Detroit News | accessdate = October 22, 2012}}</ref>

During the same season, in a game against the [[University of Chicago]], Ford "became the only future U.S. president to tackle a future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner when he brought down running back [[Jay Berwanger]], who would win the first Heisman the following year".<ref>{{cite news |title=Ford one of most athletic Presidents |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16367165/ |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco (a benefit for crippled children), played on January 1, 1935.

Ford remained interested in football and his school throughout life, occasionally attending games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices, at one point asking to join the players in the huddle.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clumsy image aside, Ford was Accomplished Athlete|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 28, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/bal-sp.ford28dec28,0,6535524.story}}</ref> Ford often had the Naval band play the University of Michigan fight song, ''[[The Victors]]'', before state events instead of ''[[Hail to the Chief]]''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Press and the Ford Presidency | author=Rozell, Mark J. | date=October 15, 1992 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=0-472-10350-4 | page=38}}</ref> He also selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U.S. Capitol.<ref>Anne E.

Ford was also an avid golfer. In 1977, he shot a [[hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He received the 1985 [[Old Tom Morris Award]] from the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America]], GCSAA's highest honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcsaa.org/_common/templates/GcsaaSubNavigationLayout.aspx?id=333|title=Old Tom Morris Award Recipients|publisher=Golf Course Superintendents Association of America|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

===Education===
At Michigan, Ford became a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Omicron chapter) and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses. Following his graduation in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, he turned down contract offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] to take a coaching position at Yale and apply to its law school.<ref name="proball">{{cite book|title=Vice Presidents of the United States 1789–1993|author=Wendy Wolff|year=1997|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}</ref> Ford continued to contribute to football and boxing, accepting an assistant coaching job for both at Yale in September 1935.<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum|accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref>

Ford hoped to attend Yale's law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school, because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]<ref name="umlaw">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html |title=The U-M Remembers Gerald R. Ford |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=January 2, 2007}}</ref> and was eventually admitted in spring 1938 to [[Yale Law School]].<ref name="librarybio">{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Gerald R. Ford Biography |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum| accessdate=January 2, 2007}}</ref> Ford earned his LL.B. degree in 1941 (later amended to [[Juris Doctor]]), graduating in the top 25 percent of his class. His introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in [[Wendell Willkie]]'s presidential campaign.
While attending Yale Law School, he joined a group of students led by [[R. Douglas Stuart, Jr.]], and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].<ref name="onlinereader">{{cite web |last=Doenecke|first=Justus D.|year=1990 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |accessdate=December 28, 2006}} p. 7</ref>

Ford graduated from law school in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan [[bar (law)|bar]] shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, [[Philip W. Buchen]],<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline"/> who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel. But overseas developments caused a change in plans, and Ford responded to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by enlisting in the Navy.<ref name="navy">{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=James M. |author2=Adam Clymer |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?pagewanted=4 |title=Gerald Ford, 38th President, Dies at 93 years and 165 day |work=The New York Times |publisher=Naval Historical Center |accessdate=October 19, 2007}}</ref>

==Naval service in World War II==

Ford is second from the right, in the front row.]]
Ford received a commission as [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the one year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] on June 2, 1942, and to Lieutenant in March 1943.

[[Image:Gerald Ford playing basketball on USS Monterey 06-1944-Darkened Larger.jpg|right|thumb|Navy pilots in forward elevator well playing basketball. Jumper at left is Gerald R. Ford, mid-1944]]
Applying for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26}}, at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin (islands)|Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref name="hove">{{cite book |last=Hove |first=Duane |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |isbn=1-57249-307-0|year=2003}}</ref> After overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].<ref name="hove"/>

Although the ship was not damaged by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by the [[typhoon]] that hit [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey's]] Third Fleet on [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|December 18–19, 1944]]. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard."

Ford, serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck, was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire.  He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship’s commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship’s crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lieutenant Gerald Ford and Typhoon Cobra|url=http://www.navyhistory.org/2013/02/lieutenant-gerald-ford-and-typhoon-cobra/|publisher=[[Naval Historical Foundation]]|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

After the fire the ''Monterey'' was declared unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached [[Ulithi]] on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to [[Bremerton, Washington]] where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]] as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. In January 1946, he was sent to the Separation Center, [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23, 1946. On June 28, 1946, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve.

For his naval service, Gerald Ford earned the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine engagement stars for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation. He also received the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two bronze stars for Leyte and Mindoro, as well as the [[American Campaign Medal|American Campaign]] and [[World War II Victory Medal]]s.<ref name="navy"/>

Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the [[United States Junior Chamber|Junior Chamber of Commerce]] (Jaycees), [[American Legion]], [[AMVETS]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[Sons of the Revolution]],<ref name="Ford">

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and Betty Ford following their marriage.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in a suit leads a flower-carrying woman by the hand, walking out of a chapel.|The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948]]
On October 15, 1948, at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer Warren]] (1918–2011), a department store fashion consultant. Warren had been a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. She had previously been married to and divorced from William G. Warren.

At the time of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane|last=Howard |authorlink=Jane Howard (journalist) |title=The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work=The New York Times|date=December 8, 1974}}</ref>

After returning to Grand Rapids, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to take on [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. "I came back a converted [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]", Ford wrote, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]].

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding the Grand Rapids [[congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty.

===Warren Commission===
[[File:Lbj-wc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Warren Commission]] presents its report to President Johnson]]

{{Further|Warren Commission|Assassination of John F. Kennedy }}
In November 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the accused assassin.<ref>In 1997, the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) released a document that revealed that Ford had altered the first draft of the report to read, "A bullet had entered the base of the back of [Kennedy's] neck slightly to the right of the spine." Some believed that Ford had elevated the location of the wound from its true location in the back to the neck to support the Commission's conclusions. The original first draft of the Warren Commission Report stated that a bullet had entered Kennedy's "back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine". Ford replied in an introduction to a new edition of the Warren Commission Report in 2004:
<blockquote>I have been accused of changing some wording on the Warren Commission Report to favor the lone-assassin conclusion. That is absurd. Here is what the draft said: "A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine." To any reasonable person, "above the shoulder and to the right" sounds very high and way off the side—and that's what it sounded like to me. That would have given the totally wrong impression. Technically, from a medical perspective, the bullet entered just to the right at the base of the neck, so my recommendation to the other members was to change it to say, "A bullet had entered the back of his neck, slightly to the right of the spine." After further investigation, we then unanimously agreed that it should read, "A bullet had entered the base of his neck slightly to the right of the spine." As with any report, there were many clarifications and language changes suggested by several of us.</blockquote>
Ford's description matched a [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0501a.htm drawing] prepared for the Commission under the direction of Dr. James J. Humes, supervisor of Kennedy's autopsy, who in his [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0178a.htm testimony to the Commission] said three times that the entrance wound was in the "low neck". The Commission was not shown the autopsy photographs.</ref> The Commission's work continues to be debated in the public arena.

In the preface to his book, ''A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission'', Ford said the [[CIA]] destroyed or kept from investigators critical secrets connected to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He said the commission's probe put "certain classified and potentially damaging operations in danger of being exposed". The CIA's reaction, he added, "was to hide or destroy some information, which can easily be misinterpreted as collusion in JFK's assassination".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Ford | first=Gerald R. | title=A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission | year=2007|publisher=The FlatSigned Press|isbn=978-1-934304-02-0 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=HOCdGQAACAAJ}}</ref>

According to a 1963 [[FBI]] memo released in 2008, Ford secretly provided the FBI with information about two of his fellow commission members, both of whom were unsure with regards to the FBI's conclusions about the assassination.<ref name="WarrenJustice">{{cite book|title=Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made|last=Newton|first=Jim|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2007|isbn= 978-1-59448-270-0}}</ref> The FBI position was that President Kennedy was shot by a single gunman firing from the Texas Book Depository.

In 1964, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as Minority Leader.<ref name="mastersDavidson">{{cite book|title=Masters of the House: Congressional leadership over two centuries|publisher=Westview Press|year=1988|pages=267–275|author=Roger H. Davidson, Susan Webb Hammond, Raymond Smock}}</ref>

The Republicans had 140 seats in the House compared with the 295 seats held by the Democrats. Consequently, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the "[[Great Society]]." During the first session of the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.<ref name="unger104">Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104.</ref>

Criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow in 1966, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966|1966 midterm elections]] saw a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.<ref name="mastersDavidson"/>

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public following a speech from the floor of the House, in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion.<ref name="mastersDavidson"/> The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of playing "too much football without a helmet".<ref name="mastersDavidson"/><ref name="Timesteady">{{cite news|title=Gerald Ford: Steady Hand for a Nation in Crisis|work=Time |author=Gray, Paul|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1572927,00.html}}</ref>

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with famed [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies.

Ford's role shifted under President Nixon to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]]. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue Sharing]] program for state and local governments.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Social Policy|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=1-4129-5076-7|page=162|author=James Midgley, Michelle Livermore}}</ref> Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).<ref name="mastersDavidson"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|author=Hoff, Joan|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=69|isbn=0-465-05105-7}}</ref>

During the 8 years (1965–1973) he served as Minority Leader, Ford won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.<ref name="mastersDavidson"/> An office building in the U.S. Capitol Complex, House Annex 2, was renamed for Gerald Ford as the [[Ford House Office Building]].

==Vice Presidency, 1973–74==
[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;1973.jpg|thumb|alt=Two women are flanked by two men in suits, standing in a room of the White House.|Gerald and Betty Ford with the President and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] after President Nixon nominated Ford to be Vice President, October 13, 1973]]
On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned and then pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to ''The New York Times'', "Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later".<ref name="nyt-editorial"/>

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: [[Gaylord Nelson]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Thomas Eagleton]] of [[Missouri]] and [[William Hathaway]] of [[Maine]]. On December 6, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States. Ford's brief tenure as Vice-President was little noted by the media as reporters were preoccupied by the continuing revelations about the [[Watergate scandal]]—a political scandal resulting from the discovery of a series of crimes committed during the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] and allegations of cover-ups by the White House.

Following Ford's appointment, the Watergate investigation continued until [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford on Thursday, August 1, 1974, and told him that "[[smoking gun]]" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in Washington, D.C. However, "Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me," Ford later related, "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.{{'"}}<ref name="kunhardt"/>

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial.

===Midterm elections===

{{Main|United States House elections, 1974|United States Senate elections, 1974}}
The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place fewer than three months after Ford assumed office and in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[United States House elections, 1974|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, necessary to override a Presidential veto (or to propose a constitutional amendment). Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865–1869).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, May 1, 2007.

Ford was confronted with a potential [[swine flu]] [[pandemic]]. In the early 1970s, an [[influenza]] strain [[H1N1]] shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans.

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was passed by the house, and vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.<ref name="Lenczowski"/> As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].
[[File:Gerald Ford with Anwar Sadat in Salzburg 1975.jpg|thumb|Ford with [[Anwar Sadat]] in Salzburg, 1975]]
In the continuing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress. Ford considered it "stalling" and wrote, "Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell."<ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240</ref> During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:
{{Quote|I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations. I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests ... are protected. You will be notified of our decision.<ref>Rabin, Yitzak (1996), ''The Rabin Memoirs'', University of California Press, p. 256, ISBN 978-0-520-20766-0</ref>}}

On March 24, Ford received congressional leaders of both parties and informed them of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. "Reassessment", in practical terms, meant to cancel or suspend further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was "an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations".<ref>Yitzak Rabin, The Rabin Memoirs, ISBN 0-520-20766-1 , p261</ref> As could be expected, the announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford "experienced a real shock", seventy-six senators wrote him a letter urging him to be "responsive" to Israel's request for $2.59&nbsp;billion in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's [foreign policy] prerogatives.<ref>[[George Lenczowski]], American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150</ref> The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli "war of nerves" or "test of wills",<ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298</ref> and after much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II), was formally signed on September 1 and aid resumed.

====Vietnam====
[[File:Kissinger, Ford and Mao, 1975 A7912.jpg|thumb|Ford and his daughter Susan watch as Henry Kissinger shakes hands with [[Mao Zedong]], December 2, 1975]]
One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American [[POW|prisoners of war]]. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Church, Peter|title=A Short History of South-East Asia|location=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2006|pages=193–194|isbn=978-0-470-82181-7}}</ref>

The accords had been negotiated by [[United States National Security Advisor]] Kissinger and North Vietnamese [[politburo]] member [[Le Duc Tho]]. South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend his government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.<ref name="Brinkley1">{{cite book |author=Brinkley, Douglas |year=2007 |title=Gerald R.

In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long Province|Phuoc Long]].

1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. Military and [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters took evacuees to [[U.S. Navy]] ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the [[fall of Saigon]]. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Vietnam War: An Almanac| last=Bowman| first=John S.| publisher=Pharos Books| year=1985| isbn=0-911818-85-5|page=434}}</ref>

Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]].

====Mayaguez and Panmunjom====
North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[international waters]] and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.<ref>Gawthorpe, A. J. (2009), "The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon", ''The Historical Journal'', '''52'''(3):697–716.</ref>

The first crisis was the [[Mayaguez Incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=May 19, 1975|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750519a.htm|title=Debrief of the Mayaguez Captain and Crew|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.<ref name="marinemerchants">{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.usmm.org/mayaguez.html |title=Capture and Release of SS Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge forces in May 1975 |publisher=United States Merchant Marine |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.<ref>Gerald R. Ford, ''A Time to Heal'', p. 284</ref> The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] wall in Washington, D.C.

Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot.<ref>Cécile Menétray-Monchau (August 2005), "The Mayaguez Incident as an Epilogue to the Vietnam War and its Reflection on the Post-Vietnam Political Equilibrium in Southeast Asia", ''Cold War History'', p. 346.</ref> But recent work by Andrew Gawthorpe, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.<ref>Gawthorpe, "The Ford Administration and Security Policy", pp. 707–709.</ref>

The second crisis, known as the [[axe murder incident]], occurred at [[Panmunjom]], a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. At the time, this was the only part of the DMZ where forces from the North and the South came into contact with each other. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.<ref>Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47–83.</ref> Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.<ref>Gawthorpe, "The Ford Administration and Security Policy", p. 711.</ref>

At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as "the paper tigers of Saigon" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.<ref>Gawthorpe, "The Ford Administration and Security Policy", pp. 710–714.</ref>

====Indonesian invasion of East Timor====
[[East Timor]]'s decolonization due to political instability in Portugal saw Indonesia posture to annex the new state in 1975. Just hours before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor on 7 December 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation. Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American-Indonesian relationship.<ref>Ricklefs, "A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1200", p. 342.</ref>

Under Ford, a policy of arms sales to the Suharto regime began in 1975, before the invasion. "Roughly 90%" of the Indonesian army's weapons at the time of East Timor's invasion were provided by the U.S. according to George H. Aldrich, a former State Department Deputy Legal Advisor's hearing at the 1977 House International Relations Committee hearing. Post-invasion, Ford's military aid averaged about $30 million annually throughout [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|East Timor's occupation]], and arms sales increased exponentially under President Carter. This policy continued until 1999.<ref name="WPI">{{cite web|title=Report: U.S. Arms Transfers to Indonesia 1975-1997 - World Policy Institute - Research Project|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/indoarms.html|website=World Policy Institute|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former [[Governor of California]] Ronald Reagan and the party's [[American conservatism|conservative]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]] (negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]]). Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous [[United States presidential primary|primaries]], including [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Indiana]], and [[California]], before withdrawing from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. The conservative insurgency had already convinced Ford to drop the more [[American liberalism|liberal]] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9603/29/index.shtml Another Loss For the Gipper].

In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. [[Chevy Chase]] often did [[pratfall]]s on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, "He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree."<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/10-19-2004/0002287784&EDATE= VH1 News Presents: Politics: A Pop Culture History Premiering Wednesday, October 20 at 10:00&nbsp;pm (ET/PT)].

Two other men are seated, facing the podiums.|Ford (at right) and Jimmy Carter in a [[United States presidential election debates|debate]] on September 23, 1976.]]

Democratic nominee and former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] [[Jimmy Carter]] campaigned as an outsider and reformer, gaining support from voters dismayed by the [[Watergate scandal]] and Nixon pardon. After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a "blanket pardon" for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed only to shift 11,000 votes in two of those four states in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having "lusted in my heart" for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised [[U.S. presidential election debates|presidential debate]] since [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.

[[File:President Ford campaigns at the Nassau County Veterans Coliseum - NARA - 7027912.jpg|thumb|right|Ford campaigns at the Nassau County Veterans Coliseum in Hempstead, New York on October 31, 1976 during the final days of his reelection campaign.]]

Televised [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election.  As such, Ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." Ford also said that he did not "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1976/|title=1976 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref> In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner [[Max Frankel]] was visibly incredulous at the response.<ref name="pbs2000">{{cite web |last=Lehrer|first=Jim|year=2000 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1976-broadcast.html |title=1976:No Audio and No Soviet Domination |work=Debating Our Destiny|publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}</ref> As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter.<ref>[http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html "Presidential Election 1976 States Carried"]. multied.com. Retrieved December 31, 2006.</ref> Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford managed to close what was once a 34-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. Despite his defeat, Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.

Had Ford won the election, the provisions of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] would have disqualified him from running in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], because he had served more than two years of Nixon's remaining term.

==Post-presidential years, 1977–2006==

===Activity===
The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]] by praising the outgoing President, saying, "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."<ref name="JC">{{cite web |date=January 20, 1977|url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres60.html|title=Jimmy Carter |work=U.S. Inaugural Addresses|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency and continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]] in [[Philadelphia]] then served as its chairman of the board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.<ref>Perrone, Marguerite. "Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953–2003". 2003.</ref> Later in the year, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M.

A review in ''Foreign Affairs'' described it as, "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye."<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|title=A Time to Heal|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1979|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19790901fabook14015/gerald-r-ford/a-time-to-heal.html|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}</ref> In addition to his autobiography, in 1987 Ford wrote ''Humor and the Presidency'', a book of humorous political anecdotes.

During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of [[Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |last=Kornblut |first=Anne |date=December 29, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29funeral.html?ex=1325048400&en=44d6cd10bbdba342&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title=Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 4, 2007}}</ref> Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], visited the Fords' home frequently.<ref>{{Cite news|last = Updegrove|first = Mark K.|title = Flying Coach to Cairo|magazine = American Heritage|volume = 57|issue = 4|date = August–September 2006|url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cflying-coach-cairo%E2%80%9D|accessdate = September 28, 2011|quote="Certainly few observers in January 1977 would have predicted that Jimmy and I would become the closest of friends," Ford said in 2000.}}</ref> Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the [[National Commission on Federal Election Reform]] in 2001 and of the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] in 2002.

Like Presidents Carter, George H.W. Bush, and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees.

Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an "Accidental President" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio and [[Bill Clements]] of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented "co-presidency",<ref name="meeteye">{{cite web |last=Thomas|first=Evan |year=2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56688 |title=The 38th President: More Than Met the Eye|work=Newsweek |accessdate=January 4, 2009}}</ref> giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and [[Alan Greenspan]] as Treasury Secretary).

After his presidency, Ford joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] as a distinguished fellow. He founded the annual [[AEI World Forum]] in 1982. Ford was awarded an [[List of recipients of honorary degrees from Central Connecticut State University|honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15404901&BRD=1641&PAG=461&dept_id=17739&rfi=6|title=A $3m gift |last=Whipple|first=Scott|date=October 18, 2005|work=The New Britain Herald|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}</ref> on March 23, 1988.

In October 2001, Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to be treated equally. Period." He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.<ref>Price, Deb.

In a pre-recorded [[news embargo|embargoed interview]] with [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed "very strongly" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], calling it a "big mistake" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President.

Ford died on December 26, 2006, at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], of arteriosclerotic [[cerebrovascular disease]] and diffuse [[arteriosclerosis]]. His age at the time of his death was 93 years and 165 days, making Ford the longest-lived U.S. President.<ref>{{cite news|title=US ex-President Gerald Ford dies|date=December 27, 2006|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6211407.stm|accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> On December 30, 2006, Ford became the 11th U.S. President to [[Lying in state#United States|lie in state]].

The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a statue of Ford to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], replacing [[Zachariah Chandler]]. It was unveiled on May 3, 2011 in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, Speaker of the House at the end of Ford’s presidency: "God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again." On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: "Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule."

===Longevity===
Ford was the [[List of United States Presidents by age|longest-lived U.S. President]], his lifespan being 45 days longer than Ronald Reagan's. He was the [[List of United States Vice Presidents by longevity|third-longest-lived Vice President]], falling short only of [[John Nance Garner]], 98, and [[Levi P. Morton]], 96. Ford also had the third-longest post-presidency (29 years and 11 months) after [[Jimmy Carter]] ({{age in years and months|1981|1|20}} and counting) and [[Herbert Hoover]] (31 years and 7 months)

On November 12, 2006, upon surpassing Ronald Reagan's lifespan, Ford released his last public statement:
{{Quote|The length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends. I thank God for the gift of every sunrise and, even more, for all the years He has blessed me with Betty and the children; with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime.

Ford was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice-president.

In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable and simple-minded Everyman.
