'''Millard Fillmore''' (January 7, 1800 – March 8, 1874) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|13th]] President of the United States (1850–1853), the last [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] president, and the last president not to be affiliated with either the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties. Fillmore was the only Whig president that did not die in office or get expelled from the party, and Fillmore appointed the only Whig [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]]. He is consistently included in the bottom 10 of [[historical rankings of Presidents of the United States]]. As [[Zachary Taylor]]'s vice president, he assumed the presidency after Taylor's death.  Fillmore was a lawyer from western New York state, and an early member of the Whig Party. He served in the state legislature (1829–1831), as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] (1833–1835, 1837–1843), and as [[New York State Comptroller]] (1848–1849). He was elected [[vice president of the United States]] in 1848 as Taylor's running mate, and served from 1849 until Taylor's death in 1850, at the height of the "Crisis of 1850" over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].

As an anti-slavery moderate, he opposed [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] demands to exclude slavery from all of [[Mexican Cession|the territory gained in the Mexican War]]. Instead he supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], which briefly ended the crisis. In foreign policy, Fillmore supported [[Perry Expedition|U.S. Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan]], opposed [[Second French Empire|French]] designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by [[Narciso López|Narciso López's filibuster expeditions]] to [[Cuba]]. He sought re-election in 1852, but was passed over for the nomination by the Whigs.

When the Whig Party broke up in 1854–1856, Fillmore and other conservative Whigs joined the American Party, the political arm of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic "[[Know-Nothing]]" movement, though he himself was not anti-Catholic. He was the American Party candidate for President in 1856, but finished third. During the [[American Civil War]], Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was very critical of the war policies of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. After the war, he supported the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] policies of President [[Andrew Johnson]].

Fillmore co-founded the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/ubhistory/presidents.html|title=Chancellors and Presidents of the University|accessdate=2012-06-14|publisher=University of Buffalo, The State University of New York}}</ref> and helped found the [[Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society|Buffalo Historical Society]] and the [[Buffalo General Hospital]].

==Early life and career==
Fillmore was born in a [[log cabin]]<ref>The original log cabin was demolished in 1852, but in 1965, the [[Millard Fillmore Memorial Association]], using materials from a similar cabin, constructed a replica, which is located in [[Fillmore Glen State Park]] in Moravia.{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpresidents.org/places/13b.asp|title=Millard Fillmore Log Cabin|publisher=National Cable Satellite Corporation|website=American Presidents Life Portraits|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> in [[Moravia (town), New York|Moravia]], [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[New York State]], on January 7, 1800. His parents were [[Nathaniel Fillmore]] and Phoebe Millard. He was the second of nine children and the eldest son.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569065/Millard_Fillmore.html|title=Millard Fillmore|work=Encarta Encyclopedia|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257052070494645|archivedate=November 1, 2009}}</ref> He later lived in {{USCity|East Aurora|New York}} in the [[southtowns]] region south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Western New York: From Niagara Falls and Southern Ontario to the Western Edge of the Finger Lakes|chapter=Southern Erie County – "The Southtowns"|author=Smyczynski, Christine A.|page=136|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=2005|isbn=0-88150-655-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History of the City of Buffalo and Erie County: With illustrations and biographical sketches of some of its prominent men and pioneers, Volume I|author=Smith, H.

He left after four months, but subsequently took another apprenticeship in the same trade at [[Niles, New York|New Hope]], New York. He struggled to obtain an education living on the frontier and attended New Hope Academy for six months in 1819. There he fell in love with his future wife [[Abigail Fillmore|Abigail Powers]].<ref name="hwwilson"/> Later that year, he began to clerk and study law under Judge Walter Wood of Montville.

Fillmore bought out his cloth-making apprenticeship, left Judge Wood, and moved to Buffalo, where he continued his studies in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary. He was [[bar (law)|admitted to the bar]] in 1823 and began his law practice in East Aurora, New York. In 1825, he built a house there for himself and Abigail. They were married on February 5, 1826. They had two children, [[Millard Powers Fillmore]] and [[Mary Abigail Fillmore]].

In 1834, he formed a law partnership, Fillmore and Hall (which became Fillmore, Hall and Haven in 1836), with close friend [[Nathan K. Hall]] who would later serve in his cabinet as [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]].<ref name=Papers-1907>{{cite book|last=Fillmore|first=Millard|editor-last=Severance|editor-first=Frank Hayward|title=Millard Fillmore Papers|publisher=Buffalo Historical Society|year=1907|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P1cOAAAAIAAJ&oe=UTF-8}}</ref> It would become one of western New York's most prestigious firms,<ref name=Paletta_1988>{{cite book|last=Paletta|first=Lu Ann|author2=Worth, Fred L.|title=The World Almanac of Presidential Facts|publisher=World Almanac Books|year=1988|isbn=0-345-34888-5}}</ref> and exists to this day as Hodgson Russ LLP.

Fillmore was a member of the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]] in the 1820s and 1830s, and served as Inspector of New York's 47th Brigade with the rank of [[Major (United States)|Major]].<ref>{{cite book

In 1846, he helped found the private University of Buffalo, which today is the public [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], the largest school in the New York state university system.

==Politics==
[[File:Fillmore House.jpg|thumb|left|Millard Fillmore helped build [[Millard Fillmore House|this house]] in [[East Aurora, New York]], and lived here 1826–1830.]]
In 1828, Fillmore was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]] on the [[Anti-Masonic Party|Anti-Masonic]] ticket, serving three one-year terms, from 1829 to 1831. In his final term he chaired a special legislative committee to enact a new bankruptcy law that eliminated debtors' prison. As the measure had support among some Democrats, he maneuvered the law into place by taking a nonpartisan approach and allowing the Democrats to take credit for the bill. This kind of inconspicuousness and avoiding the limelight would later characterize Fillmore's approach to politics on the national stage.

He was a follower and associate of [[Thurlow Weed]], who had been a leading Anti-Mason. When Weed left the Anti-Masons in 1832, Fillmore did too; when Weed became the leading Whig organizer in New York, Fillmore also joined the Whigs. In 1832, he was elected [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[New York's 32nd congressional district]] a "National Republican", serving in the [[Twenty-third United States Congress|23rd Congress]] from 1833 to 1835. He was succeeded in 1834 by "Anti-Jacksonian" Thomas C. Love. Love declined renomination in 1836, and Fillmore was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] (having followed his mentor [[Thurlow Weed]] into the party). He was re-elected twice, serving from 1837 to 1843, in the [[Twenty-fifth United States Congress|25th]], [[Twenty-sixth United States Congress|26th]], and [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|27th Congresses]]. He declined re-nomination in 1842.

In Congress, he opposed admitting Texas as a [[Slave state|slave territory]], he advocated [[internal improvements]] and a [[protective tariff]], he supported [[John Quincy Adams]] by voting to receive anti-slavery petitions, he advocated the prohibition by Congress of the slave trade between the states, and he favored the exclusion of slavery from the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Fillmore, Millard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Fillmore, Millard}}</ref> He came in second place in the vote for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in 1841. He served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] from 1841 to 1843 and was an author of the [[Tariff of 1842]], as well as two other bills that President [[John Tyler]] vetoed.

After leaving Congress, Fillmore was the unsuccessful Whig Party candidate for Governor of New York in the [[New York state election, 1844|1844 election]]. He was the first [[New York State Comptroller]] elected by general ballot, defeating [[Orville Hungerford]] 174,756 to 136,027 votes,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hough|first=Franklin B.|title=A History of Jefferson County in the State of New York|year=1854|page=435|oclc=1727429|publisher=Sterling & Riddell|location=Waterton, New York}}</ref> and was in office from 1848 to 1849. As Comptroller, he revised New York's banking system, making it a model for the future National Banking System.

===Vice Presidency 1849–1850===
[[File:Millard Fillmore daguerreotype by Mathew Brady 1849.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|Fillmore in 1849]]

The [[1848 Whig National Convention]] nominated General [[Zachary Taylor]] (a slaveholder from [[Louisiana]]) for President. This upset supporters of [[Henry Clay]] and "[[Conscience Whigs]]" opposed to slavery in [[Mexican Cession|territories gained in the Mexican–American War]]. A group of Whig pragmatists sought to balance the ticket, and the convention nominated Fillmore for Vice President. Fillmore came from a free state, had moderate anti-slavery views, and could help carry the populous state of New York.
[[File:MFillmore-congressman.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of Millard Fillmore]]

Fillmore was also selected in part to prevent the nomination of the anti-slavery [[William H. Seward]], and prevent Seward from receiving a position in Taylor's cabinet. (In an era where the President, Vice President and cabinet were expected to reflect geographic balance, Fillmore would "represent" New York, meaning another New Yorker – Seward – could not be in the cabinet.)<ref>{{cite book|editor-first1=Alan|editor-last1=Brinkley|editor-first2=Davis|editor-last2=Dyer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3djEYV3R7oIC&pg=PA146&dq=%22thurlow+weed%22+vice+president+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jJ5UqrMMczjsAS15IG4BQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22thurlow%20weed%22%20vice%20president%201848&f=false|title=The American Presidency|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2004|page=146|isbn=9780618382736}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Gregory A.|last=Borchard|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d_SwDwlEjYUC&pg=PA33&dq=fillmore+seward+vice+president+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jN5UuSvHKWosATogoD4CQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=fillmore%20seward%20vice%20president%201848&f=false|title=Abraham Lincoln and Horace Greeley|year=2011|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, Illinois|page=33|isbn=9780809330454}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Walter|last=Stahr|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bWK9AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA107&dq=seward+%22vice+president%22+1848&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lDR5UuKDLafksASCw4DIDA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=seward%20%22vice%20president%22%201848&f=false|title=Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man|year=2013|pages=107–110|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781439121184}}</ref>

The Taylor-Fillmore ticket won, taking 1,361,393 votes (47.3%) and 163 electoral votes (16 states carried). [[Lewis Cass]] and [[William Orlando Butler]], the Democrats, took 1,223,460 votes (42.5%) and 127 electoral votes (15 states carried). The third-party [[Free Soil]] candidates [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.]] took only 291,501 votes (10.1%) and 0 electoral votes.

Soon the nation was roiled by the "Crisis of 1850". Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that all of the new territories should be open to slavery. Anti-slavery Northerners demanded complete exclusion. The recently admitted state of Texas claimed a large part of [[New Mexico]], and wanted the U.S. to assume the "national debt" of the former [[Republic of Texas]]. California settlers were petitioning for immediate admission as a free state, with no territorial stage. There were also disputes about slavery and the slave trade in the [[District of Columbia]], about the apprehension of slaves who escaped to the free states, and about the territorial status of [[Utah]], newly settled by the [[Mormon]]s.

Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over these issues. During one debate, enraged Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of [[Missouri]] stalked toward Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of [[Mississippi]], who brandished a pistol at Benton.<ref name="Coleman">Coleman, James P. "Two Irascible Antebellum Senators: George Poindexter and Henry S. Foote", ''Journal of Mississippi History'' 46 (February 1984): 17–27.</ref>

Taylor stunned his fellow Southerners by urging the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states. Ironically, it was Fillmore, the Northerner, who supported slavery in at least part of the territory to avoid an open break with the South. He wrote: "God knows that I detest slavery, but it is an existing evil ... and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution."

Clay constructed a compromise bill which included provisions desired by both sides. Fillmore did not comment publicly on the merits of the compromise proposals. A few days before President Taylor's death, Fillmore suggested to the President that if the vote on Clay's bill was tied, he as [[President of the Senate]] would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.<ref name="Domestic Affairs"/>

===Domestic Affairs===
[[File:Mfillmore.jpeg|thumb|upright|Official White House portrait of Millard Fillmore]] Taylor died suddenly on July 9, 1850, and Fillmore became President. The change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift. Taylor, it was thought, would have vetoed the Compromise bill (though some historians now doubt this). When Fillmore took office, the entire cabinet offered their resignations. Fillmore accepted them all and appointed men who, except for Treasury Secretary [[Thomas Corwin]], favored the Compromise of 1850.<ref name="Domestic Affairs"/> When the compromise finally came before both Houses of Congress, it was very watered down. As a result, Fillmore urged Congress to pass the original bill. This move only provoked an enormous battle where "forces for and against slavery fought over every word of the bill."<ref name="Domestic Affairs">{{cite web|last=Bahles|first=Gerald|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/fillmore/essays/biography/4|title=Millard Fillmore: Domestic Affairs|publisher=American President: Miller Center of Public Affairs|year=2010|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> To Fillmore's disappointment the bitter battle over the bill crushed public support.<ref name="Domestic Affairs"/> Clay, exhausted, left Washington to recuperate, passing leadership to Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois. At this critical juncture, President Fillmore announced his support of the Compromise of 1850.<ref name="Domestic Affairs"/>

On August 6, 1850, he sent a message to Congress recommending that Texas's debts be paid provided Texas abandoned its claims in New Mexico. This, and his deployment of 750 Federal troops to New Mexico, helped shift a critical number of northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the [[Wilmot Proviso]], the stipulation that all the Mexican lands must be closed to slavery. Douglas modified Clay's bill accordingly, and then split it into five separate Senate bills. These bills were: admission of California as a free state (which happened on September 9, 1850); settlement of the Texas boundary and debts; creation of [[New Mexico Territory]], which would be open to slavery; the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]]; and abolition of the slave trade (but not slavery), in the [[District of Columbia]].

[[File:Portrait-MillyFillmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Millard Fillmore]]
Each measure obtained a majority, and, by September 20, President Fillmore had signed them into law. [[Daniel Webster]] wrote, "I can now sleep of nights." Only a few extremists on both sides denounced the Compromise. A slave-state convention called to discuss secession drew only a few delegates. Northerners were happy with the admission of California. Nonetheless, the Compromise disrupted the Whig party, which did badly in the fall 1850 elections in the north. Northern Whigs were heard to say "God save us from Whig Vice Presidents."

Fillmore's greatest difficulty was the Fugitive Slave Law: southerners complained bitterly about any slackness, but enforcement was highly offensive to northerners. Fillmore's solution was to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law, but also enforce the Neutrality Act of 1818 against filibustering Southerners who were trying to make [[Cuba]] a slave state).

Fillmore appointed [[Brigham Young]] as the first governor of the [[Utah Territory]] in 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/fillmore/essays/biography/8|title=The American Franchise|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=American President, An Online Reference Resource|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia}}</ref> In gratitude for creating the Utah Territory in 1850 and appointing Young as governor, Young named the territorial capital "[[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]]" and the surrounding county "[[Millard County, Utah|Millard]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Winder|first=Michael Kent|title=[[Presidents and Prophets]]: The Story of America's Presidents and the LDS Church|location=American Fork, Utah|publisher=Covenant Communications|year=2007|isbn=9781598114522}}</ref>

Fillmore appointed [[Benjamin Robbins Curtis]] to seat two of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Curtis served from September 22, 1851,<ref>[[Recess appointment]]; formally nominated on December 11, 1851, confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 20, 1851, and received commission on December 20, 1851.</ref> to September 30, 1857.

He attempted four times to fill the vacancy caused by Justice [[John McKinley]]'s death.  The Senate took no action on the nomination of [[New Orleans]] attorney Edward Bradford. [[George Edmund Badger]] withdrew his nomination.  The nomination of William C. Micou, another New Orleans lawyer, was not acted on by the Senate.  Senator [[Judah P. Benjamin]] declined to serve.  The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Pierce nominated [[John Archibald Campbell]], who was confirmed by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/reverseNominations.htm |title= Supreme Court Nominations, 1789-Present |author= |website= Senate.gov |publisher= U.S. Senate |accessdate= September 8, 2014}}</ref>

Fillmore also appointed four other federal judges, all to [[United States district court]]s. [[John Glenn (judge)|John Glenn]] was appointed to the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]] and served from March 19, 1852 to July 8, 1853.

[[Nathan K. Hall]] was appointed to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] and served from August 31, 1852 to March 3, 1874.

[[Ogden Hoffman, Jr.]] was appointed to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]]. He began serving on February 27, 1851. Hoffman was reassigned several times, beginning on January 18, 1854, as the California federal courts were redistricted. He served until July 23, 1866.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1065&cid=39&ctype=dc&instate=ca|title=Hoffman, Ogden Jr.|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref>

[[James McHall Jones]] was appointed to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] and served from December 26, 1850 to December 15, 1851.

===Foreign affairs===
In foreign affairs, Fillmore was particularly active in the Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan "opened up" for trade, and so that American ships could call there for food and water on voyages to Asia, and could put in there in emergencies without being punished. They were also concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals.<ref name="Foreign Affairs">{{cite web|last=Bahles|first=Gerald|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/fillmore/essays/biography/5|title=Millard Fillmore: Foreign Affairs|publisher=American President: Miller Center of Public Affairs|year=2010|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref>

American merchants saw in the British opening of China to trade an example of the "benefits of new trade markets."<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/> Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster dispatched [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew C. Perry]] to open Japan to relations with the outside world.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/> Though Perry did not reach Japan until after the end of Fillmore's term, Fillmore ordered the [[Perry Expedition]], and its success is to his credit.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/>

Fillmore was also a staunch opponent of European meddling in Hawaii. France under [[Napoleon III]] attempted to annex Hawaii, but backed down after Fillmore issued  strongly worded message suggesting that "the United States would not stand for any such action."<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/>

Though President Taylor had signed the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] preventing Britain and the U.S. from acquiring new possessions in the Americas, Great Britain and the United States were still attempting to gain ground in the region.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/> The situation became tense enough that Fillmore ordered several warships to guard American merchants in an attempt to prevent British interference.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/>

Fillmore had difficulties regarding [[Cuba]]. Many southerners wanted to expand slave territory in the U.S., but the Missouri Compromise and other laws prevented that. Cuba was a colony of Spain where slavery was practiced. Therefore some of these southerners tried to get Cuba annexed to the U.S. as a slave state.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/> [[Venezuela]]n adventurer [[Narciso López]] recruited Americans for three "filibustering" expeditions to Cuba, in the hope of overthrowing Spanish rule there. His first attempt in 1849 was suppressed by U.S. officials by orders of President Taylor. López tried again a year later; he reached Cuba but was chased away by Spanish troops and disbanded his force in [[Key West]]. López and several of his followers were indicted for breach of the Neutrality Act, but were quickly acquitted by friendly Southern juries.<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/>

Many southerners felt Fillmore should have supported the invasion, while some northern Democrats were upset at his apology to Spain. France and Britain dispatched warships to the region in response. Fillmore sent a stern warning saying that under certain conditions control of Cuba "might be almost essential to our [America's] safety."<ref name="Foreign Affairs"/> López tried a third time in 1851. This time most of his force was captured by the Spanish. He and many of his American followers were executed, provoking outrage among American sympathizers and causing further embarrassment for Fillmore.

Another issue that came up during Fillmore's presidency was the arrival of [[Lajos Kossuth]], the exiled leader of a failed [[Hungary|Hungarian]] revolution. Kossuth wanted the U.S. to recognize Hungary's independence. Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were now coming to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. This would require the U.S. to abandon its policy of nonintervention in European affairs. Fillmore ultimately refused to change American policy, and remained neutral.

=== Election of 1852 and completion of term ===
{{Main|1852 Whig National Convention}}
As the [[United States presidential election, 1852|election of 1852]] approached, Fillmore had been long undecided whether to run for a full term as President. In early 1852, he decided he would. The Whigs held their [[1852 Whig National Convention|National Convention]] in June that year. Fillmore was then unpopular with northern Whigs for signing and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. He led narrowly on the early ballots, but was short of a majority and could gain no votes. On the 52nd ballot, Daniel Webster's delegates switched to General [[Winfield Scott]], winning him the nomination on the 53rd ballot.<ref>Stan M.

==Later life==
[[File:Fillmore2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|150px|Fillmore/Donelson campaign poster]]

Fillmore's wife Abigail, who had been unwell for years, died March 30, 1853, less than one month after he left office.

Fillmore was one of the founders of the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]. The school was chartered by an act of the New York State Legislature on May 11, 1846, and at first was only a medical school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ublib.buffalo.edu/archives/timeline/time1.html|title=Timeline of UB History|publisher=University at Buffalo|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Fillmore was the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], a position he held as Vice President and as President. After leaving office, Fillmore returned to Buffalo and continued to serve as chancellor of the school.

On July 26, 1854, Fillmore's daughter Mary died suddenly of [[cholera]].<ref>Millard Fillmore, author,  Frank H. Severance, editor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fTAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25&dq=millard+fillmore+daughter+mary+abigail+died+july+1854&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z_2rU6rEH6izsASGh4C4Dg&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=millard%20fillmore%20daughter%20mary%20abigail%20died%20july%201854&f=false Millard Fillmore Papers], Volume X, 1907, page 25</ref><ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=2706 Mary Abigail Fillmore] at [http://www.findagrave.com/ ''Find A Grave'']</ref> Now left alone, Fillmore went abroad. While touring Europe in 1855, Fillmore was offered an [[Honorary doctorate|honorary]] [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the "literary nor scientific attainment" to justify the degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipl.org/div/potus/mfillmore.html|title=Millard Fillmore|publisher=[[Internet Public Library]]|accessdate=2013-12-20}}</ref> He is also quoted as having explained that he "lacked the benefit of a classical education" and could not, therefore, understand the [[Latin]] text of the diploma, adding that he believed "no man should accept a degree he cannot read."<ref name="hwwilson">{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=feb9603f-4cae-4040-ba2f-8cf833dc2390%40sessionmgr111&vid=1&hid=120&bdata=JmF1dGh0eXBlPWdlbyZnZW9jdXN0aWQ9czg0NzU3NDEmc2l0ZT1laG9zdC1saXZlJnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#db=f5h&AN=6494999|title=Millard Fillmore|publisher=EBSCO Industries, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref>

[[File:KnowNothingPresidentialCounty1856.gif|right|thumb|250px|1856 election results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for Fillmore in each county]]
When Fillmore returned to the U.S., the Whig Party had broken up over slavery issues and especially the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854. Most former northern Whigs, including Fillmore's old mentor Weed, joined the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Fillmore instead followed conservative and southern Whigs by joining the American Party, the political organ of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic [[Know-Nothing]] movement. [[File:Millard Fillmore. Waist length, seated - NARA - 530497.jpg|thumb|Millard Fillmore during the Civil War]] Fillmore was not himself anti-Catholic – his daughter Mary had attended a girls' Catholic boarding school for a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=14|title=First Lady Biography: Abigail Fillmore|publisher=The National First Ladies' Library|accessdate=2013-12-19}}</ref> and he contributed to the construction of  [[St. Joseph Cathedral (Buffalo, New York)|St. Joseph Cathedral]] in Buffalo<ref name="Kunz Goldman">{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/walking-in-footsteps-of-buffalo-presidents-20140216|title=Walking in footsteps of Buffalo presidents|last=Kunz Goldman|first=Mary|date=16 February 2014|work=[[The Buffalo News]]}}</ref> – but at this time, the American Party was the only alternative for non-Democrats who were not militantly anti-slavery.

The American Party chose Fillmore as its presidential nominee for the [[United States presidential election, 1856|election of 1856]]. He thus sought a nonconsecutive second term as president (a feat accomplished only once, by [[Grover Cleveland]]). His running mate was [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], nephew of former president [[Andrew Jackson]]. [[James Buchanan]] and [[John C. Breckinridge]] were the Democrat candidates, and won 1,836,072 votes (45.3%) and 174 electoral votes (19 states carried). [[John C. Fremont]] and [[William L. Dayton]] were the Republican candidates and won 1,342,345 votes (33.1%) and 114 electoral votes (11 states carried). Fillmore and Donelson finished third, winning 873,053 votes (21.6%) and carrying the state of Maryland and its 8 electoral votes. This was one of the best showings ever by a third-party presidential candidate.

On February 10, 1858, Fillmore married [[Caroline Fillmore|Caroline McIntosh]], a wealthy widow. Their combined wealth allowed them to purchase a big house in Buffalo, New York. They were noted for lavish hospitality in their home, until Mrs. Fillmore's health began to decline in the 1860s.

Fillmore helped found the Buffalo Historical Society (now the [[Buffalo History Museum]]) in 1862 and served as its first president.

In the election of 1860, Fillmore supported [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] candidate [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]. He denounced secession, and supported the Union war effort, but also became a constant critic of the war policies of [[President Lincoln]], such as the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

He commanded the Union Continentals, a corps of [[militia|home guards]] of males over the age of 45 from the upstate New York area. The Continentals trained to defend the Buffalo area in the event of a Confederate attack, as happened in the [[St. Albans Raid]], and was planned for [[Johnson's Island]]. They performed military drill and ceremonial functions at parades, funerals, and other events.  The Union Continentals guarded Lincoln's funeral train in Buffalo. They continued operations after the war, and Fillmore remained active with them almost until his death.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Buffalo Historical Society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7NdYAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA5-PA72|title=Proceedings, Volumes 23-37|year=1885|page=72}}</ref>

[[United States presidential election, 1864|In 1864]] Fillmore supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[George B. McClellan]] for the presidency, believing that the Democratic Party's plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the Union.<ref>Neil A. Hamilton, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hikn4BGc2nUC&pg=PA111&dq=%22george+mcclellan%22+%22millard+fillmore%22+1864+election&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iBjkU8CMIs-dygSO_YLADQ&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22george%20mcclellan%22%20%22millard%20fillmore%22%201864%20election&f=false Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary], 2010, page 111</ref>

Fillmore also maintained a correspondence with [[Franklin Pierce]], in which they agreed with each other that Lincoln had overstepped his authority and encouraged each other to find ways to thwart Lincoln's war policy.<ref>Garry Boulard, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5UoeQZVcG0MC&pg=PA43-IA11&dq=%22millard+fillmore%22+%22franklin+pierce%22+letters+civil+war&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CBzkU-uJFdOQyATZi4KgBA&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22millard%20fillmore%22%20%22franklin%20pierce%22%20letters%20civil%20war&f=false The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War], 2006, page 43</ref><ref>Robert J.

Fillmore's reputation as a Lincoln critic caused a crowd to gather outside his house after Lincoln's assassination.  Spattering his house with ink, they demanded to know why Fillmore hadn't draped his house in black bunting as a sign of mourning for Lincoln.  Fillmore asked for understanding, explaining that he was at the bedside of his ill wife, and did not know of Lincoln's death.  His explanation satisfied the crowd, which soon departed.<ref>Max J. Skidmore, [http://books.google.com/books?id=XT48zgmaVDYC&pg=PA67&dq=%22george+mcclellan%22+%22millard+fillmore%22+1864+election&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iBjkU8CMIs-dygSO_YLADQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22george%20mcclellan%22%20%22millard%20fillmore%22%201864%20election&f=false After the White House: Former Presidents as Private Citizens], 2004, page 67</ref>

After the war, Fillmore maintained his conservative position. He supported President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s conservative [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] policies, and opposed the policies of the Radical Republicans.<ref>Paul Finkelman, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_ueWiEBrTq4C&pg=PA154&dq=%22millard+fillmore%22+%22andrew+johnson%22+reconstruction&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4h_kU9asDIWRyAT86oHwAQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22millard%20fillmore%22%20%22andrew%20johnson%22%20reconstruction&f=false Millard Fillmore: The American Presidents Series: The 13th President, 1850-1853], 2011, page 154</ref>

Some northern Whigs remained irreconcilable, refusing to forgive Fillmore for having signed the Fugitive Slave Act. They helped deprive him of the Presidential nomination in 1852. Within a few years it was apparent that although the Compromise had been intended to settle the slavery controversy, it served rather as an uneasy sectional truce. Robert J. Rayback argues that the appearance of a truce, at first, seemed very real as the country entered a period of prosperity that included the South.<ref>Rayback 1959, pp. 286–292.</ref> Although Fillmore, in retirement, continued to feel that conciliation with the South was necessary and considered that the Republican Party was at least partly responsible for the subsequent disunion, he was an outspoken critic of secession and was also critical of [[James Buchanan|President James Buchanan]] for not immediately taking military action when South Carolina seceded.<ref>Rayback 1959, pp. 420–422.</ref>

Benson Lee Grayson suggests that the Fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked. Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the hostilities that had only broken off in 1848 and laid the groundwork for the [[Gadsden Purchase|Gadsden Treaty]] during Pierce's administration.<ref>Grayson 1981, p. 120.</ref> Meanwhile, the Fillmore administration resolved a serious dispute with [[Portugal]] left over from the Taylor administration,<ref>Grayson 1981, p. 83.</ref> smoothed over a disagreement with [[Peru]], and then peacefully resolved other disputes with Britain, France, and Spain over Cuba. At the height of this crisis, the [[Royal Navy]] had fired on an American ship while at the same time 160 Americans were being held captive in Spain. Fillmore and his State Department were able to resolve these crises without the United States going to war or losing face.<ref>Grayson 1981, pp. 103–109.</ref>

[[File:Fillmore Gravesite, Buffalo, NY.jpg|thumb|upright|A pink obelisk marks Fillmore's grave at [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]'s [[Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo)|Forest Lawn Cemetery]].]]

Because the Whig party was so deeply divided, and the two leading national figures in the Whig party (Fillmore and his own Secretary of State, [[Daniel Webster]]) refused to combine to secure the nomination, [[Winfield Scott]] received it. Because both the north and the south refused to unite behind Scott, he won only four of 31 states, and lost the election to [[Franklin Pierce]]. After Scott's defeat, the Whigs' decline continued, until the party broke up over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], and the Know Nothings appeared.

In the history of the U.S. Presidency, Fillmore inaugurated a new era. All previous Presidents had substantial personal fortunes, acquired either by inheritance, marriage, or (in [[Martin van Buren]]'s case) by work as an attorney. Fillmore was the first of a long line of late nineteenth century chief executives, mostly lawyers, who acquired only modest wealth during their lives, were "distinctly middle class", and who spent most of their careers in public service.<ref>{{cite web
