'''George Walker Bush''' (born July 6, 1946) is an [[Americans|American]] [[politician]] and [[businessman]] who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd]] [[President of the United States]] from 2001 to 2009, and the [[List of Governors of Texas|46th Governor of Texas]] from 1995 to 2000. The eldest son of [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], he was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. After graduating from [[Yale University]] in 1968 and [[Harvard Business School]] in 1975, Bush worked in oil businesses. He married [[Laura Bush|Laura Welch]] in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team before defeating [[Ann Richards]] in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 Texas gubernatorial election]]. Bush was elected president in 2000 after a [[United States presidential election, 2000|close and controversial election]], becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=July 31, 2012|publisher=Ushistory.org |url=http://www.ushistory.org/gov/7c.asp|title=Selection and Succession of the President|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101201235253/http://www.ushistory.org/gov/7c.asp|archivedate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> Bush is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first having been [[John Quincy Adams]] (with the other familial presidential relations having been the Harrisons [[William Henry Harrison|grandfather]] and [[Benjamin Harrison|grandson]], as well as the [[Theodore Roosevelt#Early Life and Family|Roosevelts]] having been [[Franklin D.

Eight months into Bush's first term as president, the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] occurred. In response, Bush [[Bush Doctrine|launched]] the [[War on Terror]], an international military campaign which included the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], launched in 2001 and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], launched in 2003.

In addition to national security issues, Bush also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, and [[Federal Marriage Amendment|amending]] the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] to disallow [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|url=//web.archive.org/web/20090515103309/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/elec04.prez.bush.marriage|title=Bush calls for ban on same-sex marriages|publisher=CNN|date=February 25, 2004}}</ref> He signed into law [[Bush tax cuts|broad tax cuts]], the [[PATRIOT Act]], the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the [[AIDS]] relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. His tenure saw national debates on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[NSA electronic surveillance program|electronic surveillance]], and [[enhanced interrogation techniques]].

Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator [[John Kerry]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated [[Public image of George W.

Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]].<ref name="Gallup">{{cite web|publisher=Gallup Poll|url =http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|title=Bush Job Approval at 28%, Lowest of His Administration|accessdate=January 20, 2009|date=April 11, 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090702202556/http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|archivedate=July 2, 2009}}</ref> Internationally, he was a highly controversial figure, with public protests even occurring during visits to close allies, such as the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7455206.stm|title= Protesters greet Bush's UK visit|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=June 15, 2008|date=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110130191221/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7455206.stm |archivedate=January 30, 2011}}</ref>

Bush left office in 2009, and was succeeded as president by [[Barack Obama]], who ran on a platform of change from Bush's policies.

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the [[United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.<ref name=msn/> By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.<ref name=msn/>

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], but, although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19% and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]], which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' made history for his campaign's negativity; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].<ref name=anatomy>{{cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/|title=The anatomy of a smear campaign|work=Boston Globe |last=Davis|first=Richard H.|date=March 21, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/|archivedate=April 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hook|first1=Janet|author2=Michael Finnegan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17|title= McCain loses some of his rebel edge|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009|archivedate=September 18, 2008|archiveurl=

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers by asking [[Dick Cheney]], a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], to be his [[running mate]]. Cheney was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,<ref name=msn/> and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an outright majority of the popular vote (50.7% to his opponent's 48.3%).<ref name="16 years">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16|title=And now... four more years|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=November 4, 2004|work= The Guardian|location=London|first=Julian|last=Borger|archivedate=April 22, 2008 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16}}</ref> The previous President to win an outright majority of the popular vote was Bush's father in the 1988 election.

The Bush administration increased federal [[government spending]] from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60%) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008).

That same year, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[marine reserve]] to date. The [[Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&nbsp;million acres (340,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/|title=Bush creates world’s biggest ocean preserve|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/|archivedate=November 4, 2013}}</ref> The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html|title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World’s Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii|publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008|archivedate=March 16, 2011|archiveurl=

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm|title=George W.

====Stem cell research and first use of veto power====
Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the [[Dickey-Wicker Amendment]] by Congress and the signature of President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 1, 2008|url= http://www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/briefs/stemcells/index.shtml|title=AAAS Policy Brief: Stem Cell Research|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]}}</ref> Bush has said that he supports adult [[stem cell]] research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research.

====Genetic Non-Discrimination====
President George W.

====Supreme Court====
{{Main|George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates}}

[[File:Roberts, Bush SCOTUS announcement.jpg|thumb|Supreme Court Justice nominee John Roberts and President Bush, July 19, 2005]]
Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,<ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 278">Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 278.</ref> Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]]. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes&nbsp;– Nomination of Samuel Alito|url= http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00002|publisher=Senate.gov|accessdate=July 31, 2012|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080829201552/http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00002|archivedate=August 29, 2008}}</ref>

====Other courts====

In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Bush experienced a number of [[George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]]. Debate during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according to [[The New York Times]]. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in ''status quo'', returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites the New York Times as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2564309961.html|title="Strict Scrutiny?" the Content of Senate Judicial Confirmation Hearings during the George W.

==Legacy==
George W. Bush's legacy remains a contested one, with both liberals and conservatives still holding strong feelings with regards to his overall place in history. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring after 9/11, and have also praised individual policies such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. His critics often point to his handling of the [[Iraq War]], specifically the failure to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]] that were initially the basis for the war, as well as his handling of [[Tax policy in the United States|tax policy]], [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]] as proof that George W.

Despite the ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives, it is often acknowledged that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. According to [[Princeton University]] scholar Julian Zelizer, Bush's presidency was a "transformative" one, and stated that "some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on".<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=September 22, 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3018798.htm|title=Historian tips rethink of Bush presidency|archivedate=March 2, 2014|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140302213746/http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3018798.htm}}</ref> Bryon Williams of [[The Huffington Post]] referred to Bush as "the most noteworthy president since [[FDR]]" and pointed to policies such as the [[Patriot Act]] which he argues "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" as evidence.<ref>{{cite news|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2014|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/is-george-w-bush-the-most_b_805805.html|author=Byron Williams|title=Is George W.

Since leaving office, Bush's presidency has received mostly negative reviews from professional scholars. A 2010 Siena College poll of 238 Presidential scholars found that Bush was ranked 39th out of 43, with poor ratings in handling of the economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments and intelligence,<ref name="Siena_2010">{{cite web|url=

Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that "Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office."<ref name=gallup0212>{{cite news|last= Jackson|first=David|title=Gallup: Reagan and Clinton are favorite presidents|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/02/gallup-reagan-and-clinton-are-favorite-presidents/1|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 19, 2012|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120220175717/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/02/gallup-reagan-and-clinton-are-favorite-presidents/1|archivedate=February 20, 2012}}</ref> Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40% in January 2009 and 35% in March 2009, to 45% in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141485/Bill-Clinton-Popular-Barack-Obama.aspx|title=Bill Clinton More Popular Than Barack Obama|publisher= Gallup Politics|deadurl=no|accessdate=January 24, 2014|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100721213139/http://www.gallup.com/poll/141485/Bill-Clinton-Popular-Barack-Obama.aspx|archivedate=July 21, 2010}}</ref> Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement <!--by roughly 5 percentage points--> in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/BushFav.htm|title= George W.
