'''George Washington''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|February 22,|1732|February 11, 1731}}<ref name="calendar" group="Note">Contemporary records, which used the Julian calendar and the [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, recorded his birth as February 11, 1731.

These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year.

Washington was born into the provincial gentry of [[Colony of Virginia|Colonial Virginia]]; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves, that he inherited. Although Washington owned hundreds of slaves throughout his lifetime, his views on slavery evolved, and he desired to free them and abolish slavery. After both his father and older brother died when he was young, Washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful [[William Fairfax]], who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier. Washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the [[French and Indian War]]. Chosen by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, Washington managed to [[Siege of Boston|force the British out of Boston]] in 1776, but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he [[New York and New Jersey campaigns#New York campaign|lost New York City]]. After [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware River]] in the dead of winter, he [[Battle of Trenton|defeated the British]] in two battles, retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause.

Because of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]] and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown in 1781]]. Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals, encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army, coordination with the state governors and state militia units, relations with Congress and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies. After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Unger|2013|p=18}}</ref>

Dissatisfied with the [[Continental Congress]], in 1787 Washington presided over the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] that devised a new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for the United States. [[United States presidential election, 1788–1789|Elected unanimously]] as the first President of the United States in 1789, he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation. He supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s programs to pay off all state and national debt, to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank,<ref name="Unger236">{{harvtxt|Unger|2013|p=236}}</ref> despite opposition from [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Washington proclaimed the United States neutral in the wars raging in Europe after 1793. He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795, despite intense opposition from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]]. Although he never officially joined the [[Federalist Party]], he supported its programs. [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] was an influential primer on [[Civic virtue|republican virtue]] and a warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars. He retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home in [[Mount Vernon]], and domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises. He freed all his slaves by his final will.

Washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power. He sought to use the national government to preserve liberty, improve infrastructure, open the western lands, promote commerce, found a permanent capital, reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of American nationalism.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Cayton|title=Learning to Be Washington|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Cayton-t.html?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> At his death, Washington was [[eulogy|eulogized]] as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen" by [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee]].<ref>{{harvtxt|O'Brien|2009|p=19}}</ref>

The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the [[Washington Monument]]. As the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history, Washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cunliffe|1958|pp=24–26}}</ref> He is [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|consistently ranked]] among the top three presidents of the United States, according to polls of both scholars and the general public.

{{Further|Ancestry of George Washington}}
[[File:George Washington's birthplace (1856 engraving).jpg|thumb|left|Washington's birthplace]]The first child of [[Augustine Washington]] (1694–1743) and his second wife, [[Mary Ball Washington]] (1708–1789), George Washington was born on their [[George Washington Birthplace National Monument|Pope's Creek Estate]] near present-day [[Colonial Beach, Virginia|Colonial Beach]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]]. According to the [[Julian calendar]] and [[New Year#Historical Christian new year dates|Annunciation Style]] of enumerating years, then in use in the British Empire, Washington was born on February 11, 1731; when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was implemented in the British Empire in 1752, in accordance with the provisions of the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]], his birth date became February 22, 1732.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bible Record for Washington Family |url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/faq/bible.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080101222243/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/faq/bible.html |archivedate=January 1, 2008|work=The Papers of George Washington |publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=January 26, 2008}}</ref><ref name="calendar" group="Note" /><ref name=Engber group="Note">{{cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2134455/|title=What's Benjamin Franklin's Birthday?|first=Daniel|last=Engber|date=January 18, 2006|journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=May 21, 2011}} (Both Franklin's and Washington's confusing birth dates are clearly explained.)</ref>

Washington's ancestors were from [[Sulgrave]], England; his great-grandfather, [[John Washington]], had emigrated to Virginia in 1657.<ref>{{harvtxt|Randall|1997|pp=8, 11}}</ref> George's father Augustine was a slave-owning tobacco planter who later tried his hand in iron-mining ventures.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=8}}</ref> In George's youth, the Washingtons were moderately prosperous members of the Virginia [[gentry]], of "middling rank" rather than one of the leading planter families.<ref>Dorothy Twohig, "The Making of George Washington" in {{harvtxt|Hofstra|1998}}</ref> At this time, Virginia and other southern colonies had become a slave society, in which slaveholders formed the ruling class and the economy was based on slave labor.<ref name="Peter Kolchin 1877, p. 28">Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877,'' New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 28</ref>

Six of George's siblings reached maturity, including two older half-brothers, [[Lawrence Washington (1718-1752)|Lawrence]] and Augustine, from his father's first marriage to Jane Butler Washington, and four full siblings, Samuel, Elizabeth (Betty), John Augustine and Charles. Three siblings died before becoming adults: his full sister Mildred died when she was about one,<ref name="George Washington's Family Chart">{{cite web |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/content/george-washington-family-tree|title= George Washington's Family Chart|publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> his half-brother Butler died while an infant,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/gewa/Page15graves.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623040946/http://www.nps.gov/archive/gewa/Page15graves.html|archivedate=June 23, 2008|title= Burials at George Washington Birthplace National Monument|publisher=National Park Service|work= George Washington Birthplace National Monument|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> and his half-sister Jane died at the age of 12, when George was about 2.<ref name="George Washington's Family Chart"/> George's father died when George was 11 years old, after which George's half-brother Lawrence became a surrogate father and role model. [[William Fairfax]], Lawrence's father-in-law and cousin of Virginia's largest landowner, [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas, Lord Fairfax]], was also a formative influence.

Washington spent much of his boyhood at [[Ferry Farm]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. Lawrence Washington inherited another family property from his father, a plantation on the [[Potomac River]], which he named [[Mount Vernon]], in honor of his commanding officer, Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]. George inherited Ferry Farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence's death.<ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1948|pp=1:15–72}}</ref>

The death of his father prevented Washington from crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to receive the rest of his education at England's Appleby School, as his older brothers had done. He received the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/washington/essays/biography/2 |title=Life Before the Presidency|work=American President: George Washington (1732–1799)|publisher=[[Miller Center of Public Affairs]], University of Virginia|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> and also a school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ferling|2010|pp=5–6}}</ref> Talk of securing an appointment in the [[Royal Navy]] for him when he was 15 was dropped when his widowed mother objected.<ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1948|p=1:199}}</ref> Thanks to Lawrence's connection to the powerful Fairfax family, at age 17 in 1749, Washington was appointed official surveyor for [[Culpeper County]], a well-paid position which enabled him to purchase land in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia. Thanks also to Lawrence's involvement in the [[Ohio Company]], a land investment company funded by Virginia investors, and Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia, Washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia, [[Robert Dinwiddie]]. Washington was hard to miss: At exactly six feet, he towered over most of his contemporaries.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|p=53}}</ref>

In 1751, Washington travelled to [[Barbados]] with Lawrence, who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]], with the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's health. Washington contracted [[smallpox]] during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred, but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease.<ref>{{harvtxt|Flexner|1974|p=8}}</ref> Lawrence's health did not improve; he returned to Mount Vernon, where he died in 1752.<ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1948|p=1:264}}</ref> Lawrence's position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four offices after his death.

==French and Indian War (or 'Seven Years War', 1754–1758)==
{{Main|George Washington in the French and Indian War}}
{{See also|Military career of George Washington|Battle of Jumonville Glen|Battle of Fort Necessity|Forbes Expedition}}

[[File:Washington Pennsylvania Mapb.jpg|thumb|Washington's map, accompanying his ''Journal to the Ohio'' (1753–1754).]]
The [[Ohio Company]] was an important vehicle through which British investors planned to expand into the [[Ohio Valley]], opening new settlements and trading posts for the Indian trade.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1948|pp=1:274–327}}.</ref> In 1753, the French themselves began expanding their military control into the [[Ohio Country]], a territory already claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–62), and contributed to the start of the global [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.

[[Robert Dinwiddie]], [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|lieutenant governor of colonial Virginia]], was ordered by the British government to guard the British territorial claims including the [[Ohio River]] basin. In late 1753 Washington was ordered by Dinwiddie to deliver a letter asking the French to vacate the [[Ohio Valley]];<ref name=autogenerated1 /> he was eager to prove himself as the new adjutant general of the militia, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor himself only a year before. During his trip Washington met with [[Tanacharison]] (also called "Half-King") and other Iroquois chiefs allied with England at [[Logstown]] to secure their support in case of a military conflict with the French; Washington and Tanacharison became friends. Washington delivered the letter to the local French commander [[Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre]], who politely refused to leave.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=23–24}}</ref> Washington kept a diary during his expedition which was printed by [[William Hunter (publisher)|William Hunter]] on Dinwiddie's order and which made Washington's name recognizable in Virginia.<ref>Washington, George. The Journal of Major George Washington, Sent by the Hon. Robert Dinwiddie to the Commandment of the French Forces in Ohio. New York: Reprinted for J. Sabin, 1865.</ref> This increased notoriety helped him to obtain a commission to raise a company of 100 men and start his military career.<ref>Grizzard, Frank E. George Washington: A Biographical Companion. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2002.</ref>

Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the [[Ohio Country]] to protect an Ohio Company's crew constructing a fort at present-day [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. However, before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of [[Fort Duquesne]]. A small detachment of French troops led by [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. On May 28, 1754 Washington and some of his militia unit, aided by their [[Mingo]] allies, ambushed the French in what has come to be called the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]]. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of some controversy, but a few primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. Whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington or by another means, is not completely clear.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=31–38}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Anderson|2000|pp=53–58}}</ref>

The French responded by [[Battle of Fort Necessity|attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity]] in July 1754.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grizzard|2002|pp=115–119}}</ref> However, he was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia. Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience and impetuosity.<ref name="Ellis, 2004 pp. 17">{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|pp=17–18}}</ref> These events had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission.<ref name="Ellis, 2004 pp. 17"/> Both France and Great Britain were ready to fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.<ref>{{harvtxt|Anderson|2005|pp=100–101}}</ref>

===Braddock disaster 1755===
{{main|Braddock Expedition}}
In 1755, Washington was the senior American aide to British General [[Edward Braddock]] on the ill-fated Braddock expedition. This was the largest British expedition to the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country. The French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock, who was mortally wounded in the [[Battle of the Monongahela]]. After suffering devastating casualties, the British retreated in disarray; however, Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces to an organized retreat.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=22}}</ref>

===Commander of Virginia Regiment===
Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as "Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony" and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier. The Virginia Regiment was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units). Washington was ordered to "act defensively or offensively" as he thought best.<ref>{{harvtxt|Flexner|1965|p=138}}</ref>

In command of a thousand soldiers, Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training. He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west; in 10 months units of his regiment fought 20 battles, and lost a third of its men. Washington's strenuous efforts meant that Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies; Ellis concludes "it was his only unqualified success" in the war.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|pp=15–16}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=38}}</ref>

In 1758, Washington participated in the [[Forbes Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley, when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. Washington did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=75–76, 81}}</ref>

===Lessons learned===
Although Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for, in these years the young man gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills.<ref name="ch8">{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|loc=ch. 8}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1968|pp=135–139}}; {{harvtxt|Flexner|1974|pp=32–36}}; {{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|loc=ch. 1}}; {{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|loc=ch. 1}}; {{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=77–80}}.</ref> He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats. He developed a command presence—given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|pp=38, 69}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|p=13}}</ref>

Washington learned to organize, train, drill, and discipline his companies and regiments. From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics.<ref>{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|pp=14–15}}</ref> He gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|p=80}}</ref>

Historian [[Ron Chernow]] is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results;<ref name="ch8"/> other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later [[American Revolutionary War]] service.<ref group="Note">Ellis and Ferling, for example, do not discuss this stance in reference to Washington's French and Indian War service, and cast it almost exclusively in terms of his negative experiences dealing with the Continental Congress during the Revolution. See {{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=218}}; {{harvtxt|Ferling|2009|pp=32–33, 200, 258–272, 316}}. Don Higginbotham places Washington's first formal advocacy of a strong central government in 1783. {{harvtxt|Higginbotham|2002|p=37}}.</ref> He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars.<ref>{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|pp=22–25}}</ref> On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia.<ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1968|pp=136–137}}</ref>

==Between the wars: Mount Vernon (1759–1774)==
[[File:Martha Dandridge Custis crop.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[mezzotint]] of [[Martha Washington]], based on a 1757 portrait by [[John Wollaston (painter)|Wollaston]]]]

On January 6, 1759, Washington married the wealthy widow [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Custis]], then 28 years old.

A successful planter, he was a leader in the social elite in Virginia. From 1768 to 1775, he invited some 2000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate, mostly those he considered "people of rank". As for people not of high social status, his advice was to "treat them civilly" but "keep them at a proper distance, for they will grow upon familiarity, in proportion as you sink in authority".<ref>{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|p=14}}</ref> In 1769, he became more politically active, presenting the [[Virginia Assembly]] with legislation to [[embargo|ban the importation]] of goods from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Ferling|2000|pp=73–76}}</ref>

==American Revolution (1775–1783)==
{{Main|George Washington in the American Revolution|Military career of George Washington}}
Washington opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], the first direct tax on the colonies, and began taking a leading role in the growing colonial resistance when protests against the [[Townshend Acts]] (enacted in 1767) became widespread. In May 1769, Washington introduced a proposal, drafted by his friend [[George Mason]], calling for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed.<ref>{{harvtxt|Freeman|1968|pp=174–176}}</ref> Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts in 1770. However, Washington regarded the passage of the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774 as "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges".<ref>{{harvtxt|Randall|1997|p=262}}</ref>

In July 1774, he chaired the meeting at which the "[[Fairfax Resolves]]" were adopted, which called for the convening of a [[Continental Congress]], among other things. In August, Washington attended the [[Virginia Conventions|First Virginia Convention]], where he was selected as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Ferling|2010|p=100}}</ref>

===Commander in chief===
[[File:General George Washington at Trenton by John Trumbull.jpeg|thumb|upright|''General George Washington at Trenton'' by [[John Trumbull]], [[Yale University Art Gallery]] (1792).]]
After the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] near Boston in April 1775, the colonies went to war. Washington appeared at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in a military uniform, signaling that he was prepared for war.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rasmussen|Tilton|1999|p=294}}</ref> Washington had the prestige, military experience, charisma and military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot. Virginia, the largest colony, deserved recognition, and New England—where the fighting began—realized it needed Southern support. Washington did not explicitly seek the office of commander and said that he was not equal to it, but there was no serious competition.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|pp=68–72}}</ref> Congress created the [[Continental Army]] on June 14, 1775. Nominated by [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, Washington was then appointed General and [[Commander-in-chief]].<ref name="GEN WASHINGTON">{{harvtxt|Bell|2005}}</ref>

Washington had three roles during the war. In 1775–77, and again in 1781 he led his men against the main British forces. Although he lost many of his battles, he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end. He plotted the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress.<ref name="ch3">{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>

Second, he was charged with organizing and training the army. He recruited regulars and assigned [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to train them. The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress,<ref name="War Department">{{cite web|url=http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?m=201101|title=Creation of the War Department|work=Papers of the War Department, 1784–1800|publisher=[[Center for History and New Media]]|location=Fairfax, Virginia|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref> but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials.<ref>{{harvtxt|Carp|1990|p=220}}</ref>

In June 1776, Congress' first attempt at running the war effort was established with the committee known as "Board of War and Ordnance", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name="War Department"/> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks and of all of the militia-officers.  The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites (like [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]) never mastered the art of command.<ref name="ch3"/>

Eventually, he found capable officers, such as General [[Nathanael Greene]], General [[Daniel Morgan]], "the old wagoner", with whom he had served in [[The French and Indian War]], [[Henry Knox]], his chief of artillery, and his chief-of-staff [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes, at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777) and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781), came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref name="ch3"/> [[Daniel Morgan]]'s annihilation of [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s legion of dragoons at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]] in February 1781, came as a result of Morgan's employment of superior line tactics against his British opponent, resulting in one of the very few double envelopments in military history, another being [[Hannibal]]'s defeat of the Romans at [[Cannae]] in 216 b.c. The decisive defeat of Col. [[Patrick Ferguson]]'s Tory Regiment at [[King's Mountain]] demonstrated the superiority of the riflery of American "over mountain men" over British-trained troops armed with musket and bayonet. These "over-mountain men" were led by a variety of elected officers, including the 6'6" [[William Campbell (general)|William Campbell]] who had become one of Washington's officers by the time of Yorktown. Similarly, Morgan's Virginia riflemen proved themselves superior to the British at Saratoga, a post-revolutionary war development being the creation of trained "rifle battalions" in the European armies.

Third, and most important, Washington was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown—the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won (rather than declaring himself monarch), he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs. Yet his constant reiteration of the point that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias (clearly demonstrated in the rout at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], where only the Maryland and Delaware Continentals under [[Baron DeKalb]] held firm), helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jensen |first=Richard |url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/am-rev.htm |title=Military History of the American Revolution |work=Jensen's Web Guides|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|date=February 12, 2002 |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref>

===Victory at Boston===
[[File:GeorgeWashington1775.jpg|thumb|Washington taking Control of the Continental Army, 1775.]]

Washington assumed command of the Continental Army in the field at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in July 1775, during the ongoing [[siege of Boston]]. Realizing his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. American troops raided British arsenals, including some in the [[Caribbean]], and some manufacturing was attempted. They obtained a barely adequate supply (about 2.5&nbsp;million pounds) by the end of 1776, mostly from France.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Orlando W.|title=The Supply of Gunpowder in 1776|journal=[[The American Historical Review]]|date=January 1925|volume=30|issue=2|pages=271–281|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/AHR/30/2/Supply_of_Gunpowder_in_1776.html|publisher=University of Chicago|doi=10.2307/1836657}}</ref>

Washington reorganized the army during the long standoff, and forced the British to withdraw by putting artillery on [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights]] overlooking the city. The British [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuated Boston]] in March 1776 and Washington moved his army to New York City.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1985|pp=125–134}}</ref>

Although highly disparaging toward most of the Patriots, British newspapers routinely praised Washington's personal character and qualities as a military commander. These articles were bold, as Washington was an enemy general who commanded an army in a cause that many Britons believed would ruin the [[British Empire|empire]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bickham|first=Troy O.|title=Sympathizing with Sedition?

===Defeat at New York City and Fabian tactics===
[[File:Emanuel Leutze (American, Schwäbisch Gmünd 1816–1868 Washington, D.C.) - Washington Crossing the Delaware - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', December 25, 1776, by [[Emanuel Leutze]], 1851]]

In August 1776, British General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] launched a massive [[New York and New Jersey campaign|naval and land campaign]] designed to seize New York. The Continental Army under Washington engaged the enemy for the first time as an army of the newly independent United States at the [[Battle of Long Island]], the largest battle of the entire war. The Americans were heavily outnumbered, many men deserted, and Washington was badly beaten. Subsequently, Washington was forced to retreat across the [[East River]] at night. He did so without loss of life or materiel.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCullough|2005|pp=186–195}}</ref>

Washington retreated north from the city to avoid encirclement, enabling Howe to take the offensive and [[Battle of Fort Washington|capture]] [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] on November 16 with high Continental casualties. Washington then retreated across [[New Jersey]]; the future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ketchum|1999|p=235}}</ref> On the night of December 25, 1776, Washington staged a comeback with a [[Battle of Trenton|surprise attack on a Hessian outpost in western New Jersey]]. He led his army [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|across the Delaware River]] to capture nearly 1,000 [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. Washington followed up his victory at Trenton with another over British regulars at [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] in early January. The British retreated back to New York City and its environs, which they held until the peace treaty of 1783. Washington's victories wrecked the British carrot-and-stick strategy of showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for anything short of independence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fischer|2004|p=367}}</ref> These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Presidents: George Washington |url=http://www.american-presidents.com/george-washington/|work=American-Presidents.com|accessdate=November 13, 2011|year=2011}}</ref>

Historians debate whether or not Washington preferred a [[Fabian strategy]]<ref group="Note">The term comes from the Roman strategy used by General Fabius against Hannibal's invasion in the [[Second Punic War]].</ref> to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks followed by a retreat so the larger British army could not catch him, or whether he preferred to fight major battles.<ref group="Note">Ferling and Ellis argue that Washington favored Fabian tactics and Higginbotham denies it. {{harvtxt|Ferling|2010|pp=212, 264}}; {{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=11}}; {{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1971|p=211}}.</ref> While his southern commander Greene in 1780–81 did use Fabian tactics, Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] were Fabian examples. By summer 1777, however, Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth and Yorktown.<ref>{{harvtxt|Buchanan|2004|p=226}}</ref>

===1777 campaigns===
In the late summer of 1777, the British under [[John Burgoyne]] sent a [[Saratoga campaign|major invasion army]] south from [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]], with the intention of splitting off rebellious New England. General Howe in New York took his army [[Philadelphia campaign|south to Philadelphia]] instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany. It was a major strategic mistake for the British, and Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York. In pitched battles that were too complex for his relatively inexperienced men, Washington was defeated. At the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington, and marched into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army [[Battle of Germantown|unsuccessfully attacked]] the British garrison at [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] in early October. Meanwhile, Burgoyne, out of reach from help from Howe, was trapped and forced to [[Battles of Saratoga|surrender his entire army]] at [[Saratoga, New York]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Higginbotham|1971|loc=ch. 8}}</ref> It was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically. France responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, openly allying with America and turning the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide war. Washington's loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing Washington from command. This [[Conway Cabal|attempt]] failed after Washington's supporters rallied behind him.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heydt|first=Bruce|title='Vexatious Evils': George Washington and the Conway Cabal |journal=American History|date=December 2005|volume=40|issue=5|pages=50–73}}</ref>

In the summer of 1779 at Washington's direction, [[Sullivan Expedition|General John Sullivan]] carried out a [[scorched earth]] campaign that destroyed at least 40 [[Iroquois]] villages in central and upstate New York; the Indians were British allies who had been raiding American settlements on the frontier.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grizzard|2002|p=303}}</ref> In July 1780, 5,000 veteran French troops led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|''comte'' de Rochambeau]] arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island]] to aid in the war effort.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lancaster|Plumb|1985|p=311}}</ref> The Continental Army having been funded by $20,000 in French gold, Washington delivered the final blow to the British in 1781, after a [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] allowed American and French forces to trap a British army in Virginia.

===Demobilization===
Washington could not know that after Yorktown, the British would not reopen hostilities. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible coup d'état. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kohn|first=Richard H.|title=The Inside History of the Newburgh Conspiracy: America and the Coup d'Etat|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=April 1970|volume=27|issue=2|pages=187–220|jstor=1918650|publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|doi=10.2307/1918650}}</ref>

With the initial peace treaty articles ratified in April, a recently formed Congressional committee under [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], was considering needs and plans for a peacetime army.  On May 2, 1783, the Commander in Chief submitted his ''[[Sentiments on a Peace Establishment]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Robert K.|title=Soldier-statesmen of the Constitution|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History (U.S. Government)|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/peacedoc.htm|author2=Morris J.

The original proposal was defeated in Congress in two votes (May 1783, October 1783) with a truncated version also being rejected in April 1784.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Robert K.|title=Soldier-statesmen of the Constitution|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History (U.S. Government)|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/ch3.htm|author2=Morris J.

By the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] (signed that September), Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States. Washington disbanded his army and, on November 2, gave an eloquent farewell address to his soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington|first=George|title=Letter to Continental Army, November 2, 1783, Farewell Orders; Letter to Henry Knox, November 2, 1783|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mgw3&fileName=mgw3b/gwpage016.db&recNum=347|work=George Washington Papers, 1741–1799: Series 3b Varick Transcripts|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

On November 25, the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|British evacuated New York City]], and Washington and the governor took possession. At [[Fraunces Tavern]] on December 4, Washington formally bade his officers farewell and on December 23, 1783, he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief. Historian [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] concludes that the greatest act in his life was his resignation as commander of the armies—an act that stunned aristocratic Europe.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wood|1992|pp=105–106}}</ref> [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] called Washington "the greatest character of the age" because of this.<ref>{{harvtxt|Brookhiser|1996|p=103}}</ref>

Historian John Shy says that by 1783 Washington was "a mediocre military strategist but had become a master political tactician with an almost perfect sense of timing and a developed capacity to exploit his charismatic reputation, using people who thought they were using him".<ref>John Shi, "Review," ''Journal of Southern History'' (May 1990) 46:2  p. 336.</ref>

The [[1st United States Congress]] voted to pay Washington a salary of $25,000 a year—a large sum in 1789. Washington, despite facing financial troubles at the time, declined the salary, since he valued his image as a selfless public servant. At the urging of Congress, however, he ultimately accepted the payment, to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|loc=Kindle location 11,386}}</ref> The president, aware that everything he did set a precedent, attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office, making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated European royal courts.<ref group="Note">Washington was aware that his actions would set precedents for later American presidents.

Washington was not a member of any political party and hoped that they would not be formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|p=290}}</ref> His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future [[First Party System]]. Secretary of Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] had bold plans to establish the national credit and build a financially powerful nation, and formed the basis of the [[Federalist Party]]. Secretary of the State [[Thomas Jefferson]], founder of the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda, but Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of [[Philip Freneau]]'s ''[[National Gazette]]'',<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|pp=240, 285, 290, 361}}</ref> and his attempt to undermine Hamilton, nearly led George Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet.<ref name="ChernowRon">{{cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=1-59420-009-2|authorlink=Ron Chernow|page=427}}</ref> Though Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily, Washington never forgave him, and never spoke to him again.<ref name="ChernowRon" />

The [[Residence Act|Residence Act of 1790]], which Washington signed, authorized the President to select the specific location of the permanent seat of the government, which would be located along the Potomac River. The Act authorized the President to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for this seat. [[History of Washington, D.C.#Founding|Washington personally oversaw this effort]] throughout his term in office. In 1791, the commissioners named the permanent seat of government "The City of Washington in the Territory of Columbia" to honor Washington. In 1800, the Territory of Columbia became the [[District of Columbia]] when the federal government moved to the site according to the provisions of the Residence Act.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Crew|editor1-first=Harvey W|first1=William B. |last1=Webb|first2=John |last2=Wooldridge|title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C|year=1892|chapter=Chapter IV: Permanent Capital Site Selected|page=87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1lIAAAAYAAJ&dq=Centennial%20history%20of%20the%20city%20of%20Washington%2C%20D.C&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=United Brethren Publishing House|location=Dayton, Ohio|oclc=2843595|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

In 1791, partly as a result of the [[Copper Panic of 1789]], Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which led to protests in frontier districts, especially Pennsylvania. By 1794, after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in [[United States district court|U.S. district court]], the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. The federal army was too small to be used, so Washington invoked the [[Militia Act of 1792]] to summon militias from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Coakley|title=The Role of Federal Military Forces in Domestic Disorders, 1789–1878|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SMmJsJLKmvoC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Role%20of%20Federal%20Military%20Forces%20in%20Domestic%20Disorders%2C%201789-1878&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1996|origyear=1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|pages=43–49|isbn=978-0-7881-2818-9|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> The governors sent the troops and Washington took command, marching into the rebellious districts.

===Foreign affairs===
[[File:GeorgeWashingtonByRobertField.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portrait miniature|Miniature Portrait]] of Washington by [[Robert Field (painter)|Robert Field]] (1800)]]

In February 1793 [[French Revolutionary Wars|a major war]] broke out between Great Britain and its allies and revolutionary France, launching an era of large-scale warfare that engulfed Europe until 1815. Washington, with cabinet approval, proclaimed American neutrality. The [[French Revolution|revolutionary government of France]] sent diplomat [[Edmond-Charles Genêt]], called "Citizen Genêt", to America. Genêt was welcomed with great enthusiasm and propagandized the case for France in the French war against Great Britain, and for this purpose promoted a network of new [[Democratic-Republican Societies|Democratic Societies]] in major cities. He issued French [[letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] to French ships manned by American sailors so they could capture British merchant ships. Washington, warning and mistrustful of the influence of [[Illuminism]] that had been so strong in the [[French Revolution]] <small>(as recounted by [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] and Abbé [[Augustin Barruel]])</small> and its [[Reign of Terror]], demanded the French government recall Genêt, and denounced the societies.<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|pp=335–354}}</ref>

Hamilton and Washington designed the [[Jay Treaty]] to normalize trade relations with Great Britain, remove them from western forts, and resolve financial debts left over from the Revolution.<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|loc=ch. 9}}</ref> [[John Jay]] negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794.

===Farewell Address===
{{Main|George Washington's Farewell Address}}
[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] (September 19, 1796)]]
Washington's Farewell Address (issued as a public letter in 1796) was one of the most influential statements of republicanism. Drafted primarily by Washington himself, with help from Hamilton, it gives advice on the necessity and importance of national union, the value of the Constitution and the rule of law, the evils of political parties, and the proper virtues of a republican people. He called morality "a necessary spring of [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular government]]". He said, "Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."<ref>{{cite web|title=VI. Religion and the Federal Government|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06.html|work=Religion and the Founding of the American Republic|publisher=Library of Congress Exhibition|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

Washington's public political address warned against foreign influence in domestic affairs and American meddling in European affairs. He warned against bitter partisanship in domestic politics and called for men to move beyond partisanship and serve the common good. He warned against "permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world",<ref>{{cite web|last=Washington|first=George|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp|title=Washington's Farewell Address|work=[[Avalon Project]]|year=1796|publisher=Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> saying the United States must concentrate primarily on American interests. He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations, but warned against involvement in European wars and entering into long-term "entangling" alliances. The address quickly set American values regarding foreign affairs.<ref>Matthew Spalding, "The Command of its own Fortunes: Reconsidering Washington's Farewell Address" in {{harvtxt|Fishman|Pederson|Rozell|2001|loc=ch. 2}}; Virginia Arbery, "Washington's Farewell Address and the Form of the American Regime" in {{harvtxt|Gregg|Spalding|1999|pp=199–216}}</ref>

==Retirement (1797–1799)==
[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt. Vernon (1830 engraving).jpg|thumb|Washington's plantation and farmlands at Mt. Vernon]]

After retiring from the presidency in March 1797, Washington returned to Mount Vernon with a profound sense of relief. He devoted much time to his plantations and other business interests, including his distillery which produced its first batch of spirits in February 1797.<ref name="breen">{{cite journal |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/sites/mountvernon.org/files/Breen-White%20Distillery.pdf |title=A Pretty Considerable Distillery—Excavating George Washington's Whiskey Distillery |first1=Eleanor E. |last1=Breen|first2=Esther C. |last2=White|journal=Quarterly Bulletin of the Archeological Society of Virginia |volume=61 |issue=4 |publisher=[[Archeological Society of Virginia]]|pages=209–220|date=December 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> As {{harvtxt|Chernow|2010}} explains, his plantation operations were at best marginally profitable. The lands out west yielded little income because they were under attack by Indians and the squatters living there refused to pay him rent. Most Americans assumed he was rich because of the well-known "glorified façade of wealth and grandeur" at Mount Vernon.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|loc=ch. 57, note 38}}</ref> Historians estimate his estate was worth about $1&nbsp;million in 1799 dollars, equivalent to about $19.3&nbsp;million in 2012 purchasing power.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dalzell|Dalzell|1998|p=219}}; Purchasing power was calculated at {{cite web|last=Officer|first=Lawrence H.|title=Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/|publisher=MeasuringWorth|author2=Williamson, Samuel H.|year=2011|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

By 1798, relations with France had deteriorated to the point that war seemed imminent, and on July 4, 1798, President Adams offered Washington a commission as [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] and [[Commander-in-chief]] of the armies raised or to be raised for service in a [[Quasi-War|prospective war]]. He accepted, and served as the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|senior officer of the United States Army]] from July 13, 1798 until his death seventeen months later. He participated in the planning for a Provisional Army to meet any emergency that might arise, but avoided involvement in details as much as possible; he delegated most of the work, including leadership of the army, to Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=Richard H.|title=Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783–1802|year=1975|pages=225–42|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-917551-8}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Grizzard|2005|p=264}}</ref>

=== Comparisons with Cincinnatus ===
During the Revolutionary and Early Republican periods of American history, many commentators compared Washington with the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] aristocrat and statesman [[Cincinnatus]]. The comparison arose as Washington, like Cincinnatus, remained in command of the [[Continental Army]] only until the British had been defeated. Thereafter, instead of seeking great political power, he returned as quickly as possible to cultivating his lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dl.ket.org/latin1/historia/people/cincinnatus01.htm|title=Lucius (Titus) Quinctius Cincinnatus|publisher=[[Kentucky Educational Television]]|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.characterfirst.com/qualities/wisdom/history/|title=American Cincinnatus|publisher=characterfirst online library|author=Kristin Fahrenbruck Baumgartner|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref> Remarking on Washington's resignation in December 1783, and his decision to retire to [[Mount Vernon]], poet [[Philip Freneau]] wrote: ''Thus He, whom Rome's proud legions sway'd/Return'd, and sought his sylvan shade.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38529|title=The Poems of Philip Freneau, Volume II (of III)|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] |accessdate=2014-09-06}}</ref> [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to Napoleon'' also lionized Washington as "the Cincinnatus of the West".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theotherpages.org/poems/2001/byron0101.html|title=Ode to Napoleon Buonoparte|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Washington's tomb Mount Vernon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Washington's tomb at [[Mount Vernon]], Virginia]]

On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington spent several hours inspecting his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain—later that evening eating his supper without changing from his wet clothes.<ref name=vadakan>{{cite journal|last=Vadakan|first=Vibul V.|title=A physician looks at the death of Washington|journal=The Early America Review|date=Winter–Spring 2005|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2005_winter_spring/washingtons_death.htm}}</ref> That Friday he awoke with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees on the estate that he wanted cut.

As Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the revolution and the first president of the United States, George Washington's legacy remains among the greatest in American history.<ref group="Note">Historians [[Jay A. Parry]] and Andrew M. Allison declare that Washington "was the dominant personality in three of the most critical events in that founding: the Revolutionary War, the Constitutional Convention, and the first national administration. Had he not served as America's leader in those three events, all three likely would have failed. And America as we know it today would not exist." Parry, 1991, p. xi.</ref>  Congressman [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee]], a Revolutionary War comrade, famously eulogized Washington:<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Safire|editor1-first=William|title=Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History|year=2004|publisher=W.W.

<blockquote>First in war—first in peace—and first in the hearts of his countrymen, he was second to none in the humble and enduring scenes of private life; pious, just, humane, temperate, and sincere; uniform, dignified, and commanding, his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting. To his equals he was condescending, to his inferiors kind, and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender; correct throughout, vice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his fostering hand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues. His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life—although in extreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan escaped him; and with undisturbed serenity he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man America has lost—such was the man for whom our nation mourns.</blockquote>

Lee's words set the standard by which Washington's overwhelming reputation was impressed upon the American memory. Washington set many precedents for the national government, and the presidency in particular, and was called the "[[Father of the Nation|Father of His Country]]" as early as 1778.<ref group="Note">The earliest known image in which Washington is identified as the Father of (His/Our/the) Country is in the frontispiece of a 1779 German-language almanac. With calculations by David Rittenhouse and published by Francis Bailey in Lancaster County Pennsylvania, ''Der Gantz Neue Nord-Americanishe Calendar'' has Fame appearing with an image of Washington, holding a trumpet to her lips from which the words "''Der Landes Vater''" (translated as "the father of the country" or "the father of the land") comes forth.</ref><ref name="Parryxi"/><ref name="Unger2367"/><ref>{{cite book|title=David Rittenhouse|author=Hindle, Brooke|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hgyOJO93UtAC&pg=PA92|origyear=1964|year=1980|page=92|location=New York|publisher=Arno Press|accessdate=October 7, 2010|isbn=978-0-405-12569-0}}</ref>[[Washington's Birthday]] (celebrated on Presidents' Day), is a federal holiday in the United States.<ref>{{usc|5|6103}}</ref>

===Cherry tree===
{{See also|Parson Weems#The cherry-tree anecdote}}
Perhaps the best known story about Washington's childhood is  that he chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned: "I can't tell a lie, Pa." The anecdote was first reported by biographer [[Parson Weems]], who after Washington's death interviewed people who knew him as a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey ''Readers.'' Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 however, historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, and there was no documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned it in an interview with an old person. Joseph Rodman in 1904 noted that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hughes|1926|pp=1:24, 501}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Grizzard|2002|pp=45–47}}</ref>

===Monuments and memorials===
[[File:Washington Monument Dusk Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Monument]]]]

Starting with victory in their Revolution, there were many proposals to build a monument to Washington. After his death, Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital, but the decision was reversed when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1801. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become the symbol of the Federalist Party; furthermore, the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Sheldon S. |last=Cohen |title=Monuments to Greatness: George Dance, Charles Polhill, and Benjamin West's Design for a Memorial to George Washington |journal=Virginia Magazine of History and Biography |date=April 1991 |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=187–203|jstor=4249215}}</ref> Further political squabbling, along with the North-South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.<ref>{{cite book|last=Savage|first=Kirk|title=Monument Wars: Washington, D.C., the National Mall, and the Transformation of the Memorial Landscape|year=2009|publisher=Univ.of California Press|location=Berkeley,Calif|pages=32–45|isbn=978-0-520-25654-5}}</ref> Predating the obelisk on the National Mall by several decades, the [[Washington Monument State Park|first public memorial]] to Washington was built by the citizens of [[Boonsboro, Maryland]], in 1827.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/washington.asp |title=Washington Monument State Park |publisher=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |location=Annapolis, MD |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>

{{main|The Papers of George Washington}}
The serious collection and publication of Washington's documentary record began with the pioneer work of [[Jared Sparks]] in the 1830s, ''Life and Writings of George Washington'' (12 vols., 1834–1837). ''The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799'' (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the [[University of Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/washington/fitzpatrick/|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=March 7, 2011|title=Writings of George Washington&nbsp;– Online Fitzpatrick edition|last=Fitzpatrick|first=John (ed)}}</ref>

The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come.

Jefferson called Washington "the best horseman of his age", and both American and European observers praised his riding; the horsemanship benefited his hunting, a favorite hobby. Washington was an excellent dancer and frequently attended the theater, often referencing Shakespeare in letters.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|pp=172–176}}</ref> He drank in moderation and precisely recorded gambling wins and losses, but Washington disliked the excessive drinking, gambling, smoking, and profanity that was common in colonial Virginia. Although he grew tobacco, he eventually stopped smoking, and considered drunkenness a man's worst vice; Washington was glad that post-Revolutionary Virginia society was less likely to "force [guests] to drink and to make it an honor to send them home drunk."<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|pp=187–189}}</ref>

Washington had owned slaves since the death of his father in 1743, when at the age of eleven, he inherited 10 slaves. At the time of his marriage to Martha Custis in 1759, he personally owned at least 36 slaves, which meant he had achieved the status of a major planter (historians{{who|date=August 2013}} defined this in the Upper South as owning 20 or more slaves). The wealthy widow Martha brought at least 85 "[[dower]] slaves" to Mount Vernon by inheriting a third of her late husband's estate. Using his wife's great wealth, Washington bought more land, tripling the size of the plantation at Mount Vernon, and purchased the additional slaves needed to work it. By 1774, he paid taxes on 135 slaves (this figure does not include the "dowers"). The last record of a slave purchase by him was in 1772, although he later received some slaves in repayment of debts.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hirschfeld|1997|pp=11–12}}</ref> Washington also used some hired staff<ref name="breen"/> and white [[indentured servant]]s; in April 1775, he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul Leland |last=Haworth |authorlink=Paul Leland Haworth|year=2004|origyear=1915|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5k5aiqI6p-QC&lpg=PA79&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=George Washington: Farmer|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location=Whitefish, MT|pages=78–80|isbn=1-4191-2162-6|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

Washington came to oppose slavery on both moral and economic grounds. Before the American Revolution, he had expressed no moral reservations about slavery. But by 1779, he would tell his manager at Mount Vernon that he wished to sell his slaves when the war ended, if the Americans were victorious.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ellis|2004|p=192}}</ref> He concluded that maintaining a large, and increasingly elderly, slave population at Mount Vernon was no longer economically profitable, and that people who were compelled to work would never work hard.<ref name="Wood">{{cite news | first=Gordon| last=Wood| url=http://www.powells.com/review/2004_12_16| title= The Man Who Would Not Be King| work=The New Republic ''(carried at powells.com)''| date= December 16, 2004| accessdate=August 4, 2006}}</ref> Washington could not legally sell the "dower slaves", and because they had long intermarried with his own slaves, he could not sell his slaves without breaking up families, which he wanted to avoid.<ref>Slave raffle linked to Washington's reassessment of slavery: {{harvtxt|Wiencek|2003|pp=135–36, 178–88}}.

As president, following the transfer of the national capital to Pennsylvania in 1790, Washington brought eight enslaved people to work for him in the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]] in Philadelphia, where state law would have automatically granted freedom to any slaves who had resided in the state for more than 6 months. He circumvented that provision of the law by maintaining that he was not a Pennsylvania resident and ensuring that neither he nor any of his slaves stayed in the state for more than six months at a time.<ref name=lawler1780>{{cite web|last=Lawler Jr.|first=Edward|title=Washington, the Enslaved, and the 1780 Law|url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/slaves/washingtonand8.htm|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref> When one of the slaves, [[Oney Judge]], a personal attendant to Martha, escaped, Washington complained that the slave had fled "without the least provocation," and he secretly sent agents to hunt her down. Washington could not legally free Judge, since she was Martha's dower slave. Martha urged Washington to advertise a reward for her capture, and [[Media:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|the ad]] was placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' on May 24, 1796. When the escaped former slave was spotted in New Hampshire, she said that she would agree to return out of affection for the Washington family, but only if they would guarantee her freedom, a proposal the Washingtons refused. They were still trying, surreptitiously, to recapture her two years later.<ref name=nashliberty>{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Gary B.|chapter=For Whom will the Liberty Bell Toll?

===Religion===
{{Main|George Washington and religion}}
[[File:Capitol Prayer Room stained glass window.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stained glass window]] of Washington kneeling in prayer, [[Capitol Prayer Room]], [[U.S. Capitol]], Washington, D.C.]]

The exact nature of Washington's religious beliefs has been debated by historians and biographers for over two hundred years. Although he visited several denominations in his public life, he was primarily affiliated with the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and, later, [[History of the Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church. He served as a [[vestryman]] and as [[church warden]] for both Fairfax Parish in Alexandria and Truro Parish,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Mary|title=In The Hands of a Good Providence|year=2008|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville, VA|isbn=978-0-8139-2763-3|page= 40}}</ref> administrative positions that, like all positions in Virginia while it had an official religion, required one to swear they would not speak or act in a way that did not conform to the tenets of the Church.

Like the [[deists]], Washington avoided the word "God" and instead used the term "[[Divine providence|Providence]]".<ref name="deistrefs">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&pg=PA148&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment''] Ellen Judy Wilson, Peter Hanns Reill, 2004 p. 148, retrieved April 26, 2012</ref> He never spoke of [[Jesus]], though he did refer to Christianity as the religion of Christ.

Eyewitness accounts exist of Washington engaging in private devotions.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Life of George Washington |last=Sparks|first=Jared|authorlink=Jared Sparks|year=1839|publisher=F. Andrews|location=Boston|oclc=843523|pages=522–523|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dBQOAAAAIAAJ&vq=in%20a%20kneeling%20position&pg=PA522 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

Washington frequently accompanied his wife to church services. Although third-hand reports say he took [[Eucharist|communion]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Johnson|1919|pp=87–195}}</ref> he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|loc=ch. 12}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Espinosa|2009|p=52}}</ref> He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non-communicants (as was the custom of the day), until, after being admonished by a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], he ceased attending at all on communion Sundays.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chernow|2010|loc=ch. 12, note 14}}</ref>

Chernow, in a 2010 podcast, summed up Washington's religious views:

<blockquote>There has been a huge controversy, to put it mildly, about Washington's religious beliefs. Before the Revolutionary War he was Anglican – Church of England – which meant after the war, he was Episcopalian. So, he was clearly Christian ... He was quite intensely religious, because even though he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life. I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence. The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence. The creation of the federal government and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence ... I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which sounds to me very much like religion ... Unfortunately, this particular issue has become very very politicized.<ref name="Ron Chernow on George Washington">{{cite AV media|people=Chernow, Ron |date=October 18, 2010 |title= Ron Chernow on George Washington|url= http://constitutioncenter.org/media/audio/ron_chernow_10-18-10_(64).mp3|format=MP3|medium= Podcast|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|work=We The People Stories|location= Philadelphia|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Michael Novak]] and Jana Novak suggest that it may have been "Washington’s intention to maintain a studied ambiguity (and personal privacy) regarding his own deepest religious convictions, so that all Americans, both in his own time and for all time to come, might feel free to approach him on their own terms—and might also feel like full members of the new republic, equal with every other".<ref>Novak, M. and Novak, J., ''Washington's God: Religion, Liberty, and the Father of Our Country'', Basic Books, 2007, p. 158.</ref> They conclude: "He was educated in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my[sic] conviction is, that he believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations."<ref>Novak, M. and Novak, J., ''Washington's God: Religion, Liberty, and the Father of Our Country'', Basic Books, 2007, p. 161.</ref>

==Postage and currency==
{{see also|US Presidents on US postage stamps|History of Virginia on stamps}}
Since 1847, one of the defining hallmarks of a U.S. President is his appearance on U.S. currency and postage. George Washington appears on contemporary U.S. currency, including the [[United States one-dollar bill|one-dollar bill]] and the [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter dollar]]. On U.S. postage stamps Washington, along with [[Benjamin Franklin]], appeared on the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#First national postage stamps|nation's first postage stamps]] in 1847.
