'''James Earl''' "'''Jimmy'''" '''Carter, Jr.''' (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician and member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|39th]] [[President of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. 

Carter, raised in rural Georgia, was a peanut farmer who served two terms as a [[Georgia Senate|Georgia State Senator]] and one as the [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]], from 1971 to 1975. He [[United States presidential election, 1976|was elected President in 1976]], running as an outsider who promised truth in government in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. He is the second oldest (after [[George H. W. Bush]]) of America's four living former presidents.

During Carter's term as President, he created two new cabinet-level departments: the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and returned the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. On the economic front he confronted  persistent [[stagnation and inflation|"stagflation"]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the Soviet move he ended détente, escalated the Cold War, and led the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|international boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. Running for re-election that year, he defeated [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primary challenge for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|Democratic Party nomination]], but lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|general election]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]].

Carter was highly active after leaving the White House. He set up the [[Carter Center]] in 1982, as his base for advancing human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] project, and also remains particularly critical of Israel's role in  the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

==Early life==
[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Jimmy Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]

James Earl Carter, Jr. was born October 1, 1924 at the Wise Sanatorium in [[Plains, Georgia]].{{#tag:ref|Carter was the first future U.S. president to be born in a hospital.<ref name="bourne-11-32" />|group="note"}} He is a descendant of English settler Thomas Carter, who emigrated to Virginia in 1635. Several generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Established in [[Sumter County, Georgia|Sumter County]], Plains was a small [[boomtown]] of 600 people when Carter was born. [[James Earl Carter, Sr.]], was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and had begun to invest in farmland. He had been a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]]. Carter's mother [[Bessie Lillian Gordy]] was a nurse at the Wise hospital. Carter was the first of Earl and Lillian's children; they moved several times in his infancy.<ref name="bourne-11-32">Bourne, pp. 11–32.</ref>

The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families. They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. While Earl was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. An enterprising teenager, Carter was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased.<ref name="bourne-11-32" />

Carter attended the Plains High School from 1930, first grade, to 1941. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] was by then taking a toll on Archery and Plains, but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies and Earl took a position as a community leader. Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.{{#tag:ref|A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to adventure downtown in a [[hot rod]]. The truancy was documented by a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian otherwise.<ref name="bourne-33-43">Bourne, pp. 33–43.</ref>|group="note"}} His teacher Julia Coleman was a particular influence on him. As an adolescent he played on the Plains High basketball team; he joined the [[Future Farmers of America]] and developed his long-held interest in woodworking.<ref name="bourne-33-43" />

===Naval career===
Though he had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Carter had to wait for a sponsorship to match the cost. Meanwhile he enrolled at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. After taking additional mathematics courses at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], he was finally admitted to the Naval Academy in 1943. With his short, slim stature, Carter barely met the minimum physical requirements for entry. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast with the academy's aggressive hazing culture. While at the academy he fell for Ruth's friend Rosalynn Smith, whom he would marry shortly after graduation in 1946.<ref>Bourne, pp. 44–55.</ref> Carter graduated 59th out of 820 midshipmen, by his own recollection.<ref name="bourne-72" /> From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived temporarily in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, and California, as he served deployments in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].<ref name="zelizer-11">Zelizer, pp. 11–12.</ref> Promoted to a [[lieutenant (navy)|full lieutenant]], he completed qualification for command of a diesel-electric submarine. He applied for the [[United States Navy|US Navy's]] fledgling [[nuclear submarine]] program run by then Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]], which he began in late 1952. Rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on him.<ref name="bourne-72">Bourne, pp. 72–77.</ref>

On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at [[Atomic Energy of Canada|Atomic Energy of Canada's]] [[Chalk River Laboratories]] caused a partial meltdown. The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement, and the reactor's core was no longer usable.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nN9FAAAAYAAJ&q=chalk+river+nuclear+accident+1952&dq=chalk+river+nuclear+accident+1952&hl=en&ei=hIhzTeGSFYP88Ab63-CUDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ|title=Great Events from History II: 1945–1966|last=Frank|first=Northen Magill|year=1995|page=554}}</ref> Carter was ordered to Chalk River, joining other American and Canadian service personnel. He was the officer in charge of the U.S. team assisting in the shutdown of the Chalk River Nuclear Reactor.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6YElaxt6fv4C&pg=PA64&dq=jimmy+carter+chalk+river&hl=en&ei=34dzTezyLcO2tgfgtuTuDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=jimmy%20carter%20chalk%20river&f=false|title=Memoirs of a Hayseed Physicist|first=Peter|last=Martel|year=2008|page=64}}</ref> The painstaking process required each team member, including Carter, to don protective gear, and be lowered individually into the reactor to disassemble it for minutes at a time. During and after his presidency, Carter indicated that his experience at Chalk River shaped his views on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, including his decision not to pursue completion of the [[neutron bomb]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ottawariverkeeper.ca/news/when_jimmy_carter_faced_radioactivity_head_on/|first=Arthur|last=Milnes|title=When Jimmy Carter faced radioactivity head-on|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=January 28, 2009}}</ref>

Carter took some classes at [[Union College]] in Schenectady, New York, in early 1953.<ref name="zelizer-11" /> Upon the death of his father in July of that year, Carter was urgently needed to run the family business, but he was torn over the decision. Staying in Schenectady he had the promise of a distinguished naval career, with eventual promotion to admiral a possibility. Furthermore, Rosalynn had grown comfortable with her family life and her husband's relative prestige; returning to the small-town life of Plains felt like a "monumental step backward" for her. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the military culture and yearned to take a path more like his father's. Resigning his commission, he was honorably discharged from the Navy on October 9, 1953.<ref>Bourne, pp. 77–81.</ref><ref>Hayward, p. 23.</ref>

===Farming===
Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man, recently elected to the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]. However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son inherited comparatively little. For a year, due to a limited real estate market, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor. Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, Carter took over the family peanut farm. The transition was difficult, as the harvest his first year failed due to drought and Carter was forced to open several lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Carter took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business' financials. Though they barely broke even the first year, Carter managed over the following years to expand and become quite successful.<ref>Bourne, pp. 83–91.</ref><ref>Morris, p. 115.</ref>

==Early political career==

===State Senate===
Racial tension was inflamed in Plains by the 1954 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s anti-segregation ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integration—at one point, the local [[White Citizens' Council]] boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join them—but he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board, where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integregation.<ref>Bourne, pp. 92–108.</ref> A [[Georgia Senate|state Senate]] seat was opened by the dissolution of Georgia's [[County Unit System]] in 1962; Carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election. Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. The initial results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the sheriff of [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]]. Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.<ref>Bourne, pp. 108–132.</ref>

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|Civil Rights Movement]] was well underway as Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch [[John F. Kennedy]] supporters. In 1962, the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters, echoing similar unrest throughout the country. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. He did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against [[literacy tests]] and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which, he felt, implied a compulsion to practice religion.<ref>Bourne, pp. 132–140.</ref> A diligent legislator, Carter took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload. Within two years his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration. When [[Bo Callaway]] was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in November 1964, Carter immediately began planning unseat him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter wanted it to go to [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in Americus, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. Carter saw Callaway, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics.<ref>Bourne, pp. 132–145.</ref>

Carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term. For a time in the State Senate, he chaired its Education Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. The last day of the term, March 3, 1966, he announced his run for Congress.<ref>Bourne, pp. 145–149.</ref>

===Campaigns for governor===
{{See also|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1966|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1970}}
The congressional race was shaken up in mid-May when Callaway dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead. Callaway was a very strong candidate, and state Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter soon decided to follow Callaway and run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as "Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road. ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that."<ref>Bourne, pp. 149–153.</ref> He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. A chain of events then resulted in Maddox, the [[dark horse candidate]], being elected governor.{{#tag:ref|With Carter out of the race, Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall, clinching the Democratic nomination. In the general election, the Callaway won a plurality of the vote but came short of the 50 percent majority. The election was thus decided by the Georgia House of Representatives with its Democratic majority; they settled on Maddox.<ref name="bourne-153" />|group="note"}} The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.<ref name="bourne-153">Bourne, pp. 153–165.</ref>

Carter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for Governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born around this time.<ref>Bourne, pp. 165–179.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 39–46.</ref>

The liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], was Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign than his last, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him "Cufflinks Carl") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.<ref name="bourne-180">Bourne, pp. 180–199.</ref><ref name="hayward-46">Hayward, pp. 46–51.</ref> Throughout the campaign Carter sought both the black vote and the "Wallace vote", after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]]. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.<ref name="bourne-180" /><ref name="hayward-46" />

That September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The campaign grew even more bitter; Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote—winning 7 percent of the black vote—and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter began to speak confidently against Georgia's racist politics. [[Leroy Johnson (senator)|Leroy Johnson]], a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying, "I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. ... I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist."<ref name="bourne-180" />

==Governor of Georgia==

Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. He declared in his inaugural speech that "the time of racial segregation was over. No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever again have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job, or simple justice." The crowd was reportedly shocked by this message, contrasting starkly with Georgia's political culture and particularly Carter's campaign. The many segregationists who had supported Carter during the race felt betrayed. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran a story on the [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] "[[New South]]" governors elected that year in a May 1971 issue, featuring a cover illustration of Carter.<ref>Bourne, pp. 200–201.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 49–55.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19710531,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Gov. Jimmy Carter |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 31, 1971 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

[[Lester Maddox]], Carter's predecessor as governor, became [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|lieutenant governor]]. Carter had endorsed Maddox, although the two did not campaign as a [[ticket (election)|ticket]]. The two found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.<ref>Bourne, p. 204.</ref> [[Richard Russell, Jr.]], then [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], died in office during Carter's second week in office; the newly inaugurated governor appointed [[David H. Gambrell]], state Democratic Party chair, to fill Russell's unexpired term in the Senate.<ref>Bourne, pp. 201–202.</ref>

With Carter's reluctance to engage in back-slapping and political favors, the legislature found him frustrating to work with.<ref name="bourne-204" /><ref>Hayward, pp. 55–56.</ref> He looked to aggressively expand the governor's authority while reducing the complexity of the state government. Therefore he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. He implemented [[zero-based budgeting]] within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor.<ref name="bourne-204">Bourne, pp. 204–212.</ref> The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972, but had a cool reception in the legislature. After two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session.<ref>Bourne, pp. 214–220.</ref> Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 30—a fact he would emphasize in his presidential run—although it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Civil rights were a heartfelt priority for Carter. He expanded the number of black state employees, judges, and board members. He hired Rita Jackson Samuels, a black woman, to advise him on potential appointments.<ref name="bourne-212" /> He placed portraits of Martin Luther King, Jr., and two other prominent black Georgians in the capitol building, even as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] picketed the unveiling ceremony.<ref name="bourne-250" /> Still, Carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable.  He co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.<ref name="bourne-212">Bourne, pp. 212–213.</ref> After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] threw out Georgia's [[death penalty in the United States|death penalty]] statute in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' (1972), Carter signed a revised death penalty statute which addressed the court's objections, thus re-introducing the practice in the state. Carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, "I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/11/jimmy-carter-supreme-court-death-penalty |title=Jimmy Carter calls for fresh moratorium on death penalty |author=Pilkington, Ed |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 11, 2013}}</ref>

Carter pushed reforms through the legislature to provide equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. He took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.worldbook.com/content-spotlight/item/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present?start=5|title=Carter, Jimmy|publisher=World Book Student|author=Hugh S.

In one of his more controversial decisions,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25889670/ns/us_news-environment/t/jimmy-carter-battles-plan-dams-again/#.U8HYvpRdWy4 |title=Jimmy Carter battles plan for dams – again |author=Associated Press |date=July 28, 2008 |publisher=NBCNews.com}}</ref> he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]]. After surveying the river and the literature himself, he argued that the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was underestimating both the project's cost and its impact on the region. The veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide.<ref name="bourne-250">Bourne, pp. 250–251.</ref> When Lieutenant [[William Calley]] was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the [[My Lai Massacre]] in [[South Vietnam]], a politically polarizing issue, Carter avoided paying direct tribute to Calley. He instead instituted "American Fighting Man's Day" and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military.<ref>Bourne, pp. 213–214.</ref>

===National ambition===
Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]], where the liberal U.S. Senator [[George McGovern]] was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGovern's running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry "Scoop" Jackson]], in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 Democratic ticket]] went to McGovern and Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]].<ref>Bourne, pp. 221–230.</ref>

After McGovern's loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff. He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] to boost his visibility. On [[David Rockefeller]]'s endorsement he was named to the [[Trilateral Commission]] in April 1973. The following year he was named chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.<ref>Bourne, pp. 237–250.</ref> In 1973 he appeared on the game show ''[[What's My Line]]'', where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation. None recognized him and it took several rounds of question-and-answer before movie critic [[Gene Shalit]] correctly guessed he was a governor.<ref>Zelizer, p. 15.</ref>

==1976 presidential campaign==
{{Main|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|United States presidential election, 1976}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1976.svg|thumb|300px|right|The electoral map of the 1976 election]]
When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians; his [[name recognition]] was two percent.  As the [[Watergate scandal]] of President Nixon was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. He promoted government reorganization. Carter published ''Why Not the Best?'' in June 1976 to help introduce himself to the American public.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B1FFC3E5B167493C4A8178CD85F428785F9 | work=The New York Times | first=Charles | last=Mohr | title=Choice of Mondale Helps To Reconcile the Liberals; Choice of Mondale as Running Mate Helps Carter to Reconcile Liberal Critics Candidate Tells of Painstaking Search In Effort to Avoid Mistake Like 1972's | date=July 16, 1976}}</ref>

Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the [[Iowa caucus]]es and the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He used a two-prong strategy: In the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's [[George Wallace]], Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over 50,000 miles, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates announced that they were in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/carter/player/#v276|title=Jimmy Carter|series=The American Experience|publisher=Public Broadcasting System}}</ref> Initially dismissed as a regional candidate, Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':

{{quote|What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}

Carter was interviewed by [[Robert Scheer]] of ''[[Playboy]]'' for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: "I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times."<ref>"The Playboy Interview: Jimmy Carter." Robert Scheer. ''Playboy'', November 1976, Vol. 23, Iss. 11, pp. 63–86.</ref> He is the only American president to have been interviewed by ''Playboy''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

As late as January 26, 1976, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a [[Gallup poll]]. Yet "by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] by a few percentage points", according to Shoup.<ref>Shoup (1980), ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'</ref>

He chose Senator [[Walter Mondale|Walter F. Mondale]] as his running mate. He attacked Washington in his speeches, and offered a religious salve for the nation's wounds.<ref name = "Dyer-2004">American Presidency, Brinkley and Dyer, 2004.</ref>

Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in a narrow defeat on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 [[electoral college|electoral votes]] to Ford's 240. Carter became the first contender from the [[Deep South]] to be elected President since the [[US presidential election, 1848|1848 election]]. Carter carried fewer states than Ford—23 states to the defeated Ford's 27—yet Carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote (50.1 percent) of any non-incumbent since [[Dwight Eisenhower]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Presidency==

{{Main|Presidency of Jimmy Carter}}
Carter's tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession, as well as an energy crisis. On January 7, 1980, Carter signed [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32978 Law H.R. 5860 aka Public Law 96-185] known as ''The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979,'' bailing out [[Chrysler Corporation]]. He cancelled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords; giving back the Panama Canal; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. His final year was marred by the [[Iran hostage crisis]], which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===U.S. energy crisis===

===EPA Love Canal Superfund===
In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of [[Love Canal]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a [[toxic waste]] landfill. The [[Superfund]] law was created in response to the situation.<ref>Robert W.

===Deregulation===
[[Image:AirlineDeregulationAct.png|thumb|right|U.S. President Jimmy Carter signs the [[Airline Deregulation Act]].]]

In 1977, Carter appointed [[Alfred E. Kahn]], a professor of [[economics]] at [[Cornell University]], to be chair of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading 'think tanks' in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The [[Airline Deregulation Act]] ({{USPL|95|504}}) was signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to [[Airline deregulation|remove government control]] over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from [[commercial aviation]].  The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]]'s powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell [[malt]], [[hops]], and [[yeast]] to American [[Homebrewing|home brewers]] for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of [[Prohibition in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/beer-charts |title=Beer Charts of the Day|first=Tom|last=Philpott|publisher=Motherjones.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref> This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft [[Microbrewery|microbrew]] culture in the United States, with over 2,000 breweries and brewpubs in the United States by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2010/08/how-jimmy-carter-saved-craft-beer/19195/ |title=How Jimmy Carter Saved Craft Beer – Max Fisher |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/media/press-releases/show?title=brewers-association-reports-2012-mid-year-growth-for-u-s-craft-brewers |title=Brewers Association |publisher=brewersassociation.org |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

===U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics===
{{Main|1980 Summer Olympics boycott}}
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2014}}
In response to the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], Carter decided to boycott the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, which raised a bitter controversy. It was the only time since the founding of the modern Olympics in 1896 that the United States had not participated in a Summer or Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union retaliated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. It did not withdraw troops from Afghanistan until 1989 (eight years after Carter left office).

Carter later wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which he attributed to [[Ted Kennedy]]'s ambition to replace him as president.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jimmy Carter|title=Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qqyUX6KRbZsC&pg=PA8|year=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=8}}</ref>  Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign, and Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination.

[[United States presidential election, 1980|Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980]] was one of the most difficult, and least successful, in history. He faced strong challenges from the right (Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]), the center (independent [[John B. Anderson]]), and the left (Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]]). He had to run against his own "[[stagflation]]"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He alienated liberal college students, who were expected to be his base, by re-instating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, [[Timothy Kraft]], stepped down some five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to have been an uncorroborated allegation of [[cocaine]] use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952778,00.html|title="Nation: Kraft Drops Out", September 29, 1980|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=June 29, 2013|date=September 29, 1980}}</ref> Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan in a landslide, and the Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1981, Carter returned to Georgia to his peanut farm, which he had placed into a [[blind trust]] during his presidency to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. He found that the trustees had mismanaged the trust, leaving him more than one million dollars in debt. In the years that followed, he has led an active life, establishing the Carter Center, building his presidential library, teaching at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and writing numerous books.<ref name = "Dyer-2004"/> He has also contributed to the expansion of Habitat for Humanity, to build affordable housing. As of October 27, 2014, Carter has lived longer after leaving the White House than any other U.S. President.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Carter has been involved in a variety of national and international public policy, conflict resolution, human rights and charitable causes. In 1982, he established [[The Carter Center]] in Atlanta to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering. The non-profit, nongovernmental Center promotes democracy, mediates and prevents conflicts, and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections. It also works to improve global health through the control and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of diseases such as [[Guinea worm disease]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], [[malaria]], [[trachoma]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], and [[schistosomiasis]]. It also works to diminish the stigma of mental illnesses and improve nutrition through increased crop production in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A major accomplishment of The Carter Center has been the elimination of more than 99&nbsp;percent of cases of [[Guinea worm disease]], from an estimated 3.5&nbsp;million cases in 1986 to 148 reported cases in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/index.html|publisher=The Carter Center|title=Carter Center Guinea Worm Eradication Program – Dracunculiasis|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The Carter Center has monitored 96 elections in 38 countries since 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/observed.html|publisher=The Carter Center|title=Carter Center list of elections observed|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> It has worked to resolve conflicts in [[Haiti]], [[Bosnia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]] and other countries.

====North Korea====
In 1994, [[North Korea]] had expelled investigators from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel. In response, then-President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea,<ref>Marion V. Creekmore, ''A Moment of Crisis: Jimmy Carter, The Power of a Peacemaker, and North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions'' (2006).</ref> under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter's.

Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il-sung, but went further and outlined a treaty, which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action. The Clinton Administration signed a later version of the [[Agreed Framework]], under which North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately dismantle its current nuclear program and comply with its [[nonproliferation]] obligations in exchange for oil deliveries, the construction of two [[light water reactors]] to replace its [[graphite moderated reactors|graphite reactors]], and discussions for eventual diplomatic relations.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2006, at the UK [[Hay Festival]], Carter stated that [[Israel]] has at least 150 [[nuclear weapons]]. He expressed his support for Israel as a country, but criticized its domestic and foreign policy;
"One of the greatest human rights crimes on earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1.6m Palestinians," said Carter.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

He mentioned statistics showing nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below that of the children of Sub-Saharan Africa and described the European position on Israel as "[[Wikt:supine|supine]]".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7420573.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Israel 'has 150 nuclear weapons' | date=May 26, 2008}}</ref>

In April 2008, the London-based Arabic newspaper ''[[Al-Hayat]]'' reported that Carter met with exiled [[Hamas]] leader [[Khaled Mashaal]] on his visit to [[Syria]]. The Carter Center initially did not confirm nor deny the story. The [[US State Department]] considers Hamas a terrorist organization.<ref>"[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207649973153&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jimmy Carter Planning to meet Mashaal]", ''The Jerusalem Post'', April 9, 2008.</ref> Within this Mid-East trip, Carter also laid a wreath on the grave of [[Yasser Arafat]] in [[Ramallah]] on April 14, 2008.<ref>"[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1208246574923&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull PA to Carter: Don't meet with Mashaal]."

During his visit he gave an exclusive interview to [[Forward Magazine]], the first ever interview for any American president, current or former, with a Syrian media outlet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pr-usa.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=160253&Itemid=96 |title=PR-USA.net |publisher=PR-USA.net |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/president-jimmy-carter-speaks-forward Jimmy Carter speaks to Forward Magazine]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}.</ref>

Carter visited with three officials from Hamas who have been living at the International Red Cross office in [[Jerusalem]] since July 2010.

In August 2014, Carter was joined by [[Mary Robinson]] during the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]] with the pair pressing for the inclusion of Hamas as an actor in peace talks with Israel, recognition of the group as a legitimate political entity, and the lifting of the siege of Gaza. The two [[The Elders (organization)|Elders]], in an op-ed article in  [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'']], noted the recent unity deal between Hamas and Fatah when Hamas agreed with the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence, recognize Israel and adhere to past agreements, saying it presented an opportunity.

Carter states that "one of the defenses of the Bush administration&nbsp;... has been, okay, we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us. So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective, and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted." Carter expressed his hope that Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], would be "less enthusiastic" about Bush's Iraq policy.<ref name=bbc080705/>

Due to his status as former President, Carter was a [[superdelegate]] to the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]]. Carter announced his endorsement of Senator (now president) Barack Obama. Speaking to the Syrian English monthly ''[[Forward Magazine]]'' of [[Syria]], Carter was asked to give one word that came to mind when mentioning President George W. Bush.

===Involvement with Bank of Credit and Commerce International===
After Carter left the presidency, his interest in the developing countries led him to having a close relationship with [[Agha Hasan Abedi]], the founder of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI). Abedi was a Pakistani, whose bank had offices and business in a large number of developing countries. He was introduced to Carter in 1982 by Bert Lance, one of Carter's closest friends. (Unknown to Carter, BCCI had secretly purchased an interest in 1978 in National Bank of Georgia, which had previously been run by Lance and had made loans to Carter's peanut business.) Abedi made generous donations to the [[Carter Center]] and the Global 2000 Project. Abedi also traveled with Carter to at least seven countries in connection with Carter's charitable activities. The main purpose of Abedi's association with Carter was not charitable activities, but to enhance BCCI's influence, in order to open more offices and develop more business. In 1991, BCCI was seized by regulators, amid allegations of criminal activities, including illegally having control of several U.S. banks. Just prior to the seizure, Carter began to disassociate himself from Abedi and the bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/16ga.htm |title=16 – BCCI And Georgia Politicians |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

===Abortion===
Although "personally opposed" to abortion, after the landmark [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 US 113 (1973), Carter supported legalized abortion.<ref>{{cite web

In March 2012, during an interview on ''[[The Laura Ingraham Show]]'', Carter expressed his view that the Democratic Party should be more pro-life. He said that it had been difficult for him, given his strong beliefs, to uphold ''Roe v. Wade'' while he was president.<ref>[http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/03/30/carter-jesus-would-not-approve-of-abortions/ "Carter: Jesus Would Not Approve of Abortions"], CBS Atlanta, March 30, 2012. Retrieved March 30, 2012</ref>
In a March 29, 2012 interview with [[Laura Ingraham]], Carter expressed his current view of [[abortion]] and his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more [[pro-life]]: "I never have believed that [[Jesus Christ]] would approve of abortions and that was one of the problems I had when I was president having to uphold [[Roe v. Wade]] and I did everything I could to minimize the need for abortions. I made it easy to adopt children for instance who were unwanted and also initiated the program called Women and Infant Children or [[WIC]] program that's still in existence now.  But except for the times when a mother's life is in danger or when a pregnancy is caused by rape or incest I would certainly not or never have approved of any abortions. I've signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need, requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life{{sic|?}} are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest. I think if the Democratic Party would adopt that policy that would be acceptable to a lot of people who are now estranged from our party because of the abortion issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/jimmy_carter_democratic_party_should_be_more_pro-life.html|title=Jimmy Carter: Democratic Party Should Be More Pro-Life, March 29, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>

===Death penalty===
During his presidential campaigns, he expressed his opposition to the death penalty, as had George McGovern. Two successive nominees, [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]], also opposed the death penalty.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/07/democrats_shift_on_death_penalty/ "Democrats shift on death penalty"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', December 7, 2003</ref> Carter is known for his strong opposition to the death penalty; in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture, he urged "prohibition of the death penalty".<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/12/10/carter.transcript/ "Carter Nobel Peace Prize speech"], CNN, December 10, 2002</ref> Carter continued to speak out against the death penalty in the US and abroad.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In a letter to the Governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]], Carter urged the governor to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead. New Mexico abolished the [[death penalty]] in 2009. Carter wrote: "As you know, the United States is one of the few countries, along with nations such as Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba, which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class-based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-jimmy-carter-urges-new-mexico-governor-support-death-penalty-repeal |title=NEW VOICES: Jimmy Carter Urges New Mexico Governor to Support Death Penalty Repeal &#124; Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref> In 2012, Carter wrote an [[op-ed]] in the LA ''Times'' supporting passage of a state referendum which would have ended the death penalty. He opened the article: "The process for administering the death penalty in the United States is broken beyond repair, and it is time to choose a more effective and moral alternative. California voters will have the opportunity to do this on election day."<ref>Carter, Jimmy, [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-1028-carter-death-penalty-20121028,0,6524708.story "Jimmy Carter to California: Yes on Prop. 34" (op-ed)], LA ''Times'', October 28, 2012.

===Equality for women===
In October 2000, Carter, a third-generation Southern Baptist, announced that he was severing ties to the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] over its opposition to women as pastors. What led Carter to take this action was a doctrinal statement by the Convention, adopted in June 2000, advocating a [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretation of the Bible]]. This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: "an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them." ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action "the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In subsequent years, Carter has joined with other world leaders who have spoken out about the subjugation of women by religious and other institutions. On July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment. He said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith, "nor, tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple." Carter stated:

{{quote|The truth is that male religious leaders have had—and still have—an option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women. They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter. Their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world. This is in clear violation not just of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but also the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Apostle Paul, Moses and the prophets, Muhammad, and founders of other great religions—all of whom have called for proper and equitable treatment of all the children of God. It is time we had the courage to challenge these views.<ref name=losing>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130704055257/http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/losing-my-religion-for-equality-20090714-dk0v.html Losing my religion for equality], Opinion,  Theage.com.au,  July 15, 2009</ref>}}

From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to [[Christianity]]. He teaches Sunday school and is a [[deacon]] at the Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of [[Plains, Georgia|Plains]].<ref>Somini Sengupta, [http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html "Carter Sadly Turns Back on National Baptist Body"], ''The New York Times'', October 21, 2000.

Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man. It asked, "If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"<ref>{{cite book|title=Conversations with Carter| isbn=1-55587-801-6|year=1998|page=14| first1=Jimmy |last1= Carter| first2= Don |last2= Richardson|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' noted that Carter had been instrumental in moving evangelical Christianity closer to the American mainstream during and after his presidency.<ref>Sengupta, S.

In 2000, Carter severed his membership with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], saying the group's doctrines did not align with his Christian beliefs. In April 2006, Carter, former President Bill Clinton, and Mercer University President Bill Underwood initiated the [[New Baptist Covenant]]. The broadly inclusive movement seeks to unite [[Baptists]] of all races, cultures and convention affiliations. Eighteen Baptist leaders representing more than 20&nbsp;million Baptists across North America backed the group as an alternative to the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. The group held its first meeting in Atlanta, January 30 through February 1, 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012037/http://www.newbaptistcovenant.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=36 New Baptist Covenant].

In the wake of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] [[Watergate Scandal]], exit polls from the 1976 Presidential election suggested that many still held [[Gerald Ford]]'s pardon of Nixon against him.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/27/opinion/polls/main2301584.shtml | publisher=CBS News | title=Polls: Ford's Image Improved Over Time | date=December 27, 2006}}</ref> By comparison Carter seemed a sincere, honest, and well-meaning Southerner.<ref name=indy/>

His administration suffered from his inexperience in politics. Carter paid too much attention to detail. He frequently backed down from confrontation and was quick to retreat when attacked by political rivals. He appeared to be indecisive and ineffective, and did not define his priorities clearly.  He seemed to be distrustful and uninterested in working with other groups, or even with Congress when controlled by his own party, as well as fellow Democratic senators which he denounced for being controlled by special interest groups.<ref name=profile>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Jimmy-Carter-Disaffection-of-the-public.html |title=Disaffection of the public – Jimmy Carter – election |publisher=Presidentprofiles.com |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref> Though he made efforts to address many of these issues in 1978, the approval he won from his reforms did not last long.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In the 1980 campaign, [[Ronald Reagan]] projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament.

In the years since then, his reputation has much improved.
