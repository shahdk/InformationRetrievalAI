'''Warren Gamaliel Harding''' (November 2, 1865&nbsp;– August 2, 1923) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|29th]] [[President of the United States]] (1921–23), a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from Ohio who served in the [[Ohio Senate]] and then in the [[United States Senate]], where he played a minor role.

With the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) convention near deadlock, Harding was chosen as an inoffensive compromise candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 election]]. He brought leading advertising experts on board, especially [[Albert Lasker]], to publicize his presidential appearance and conservative promises. He promised America a "[[return to normalcy]]", with an end to violence and radicalism, a strong economy, and independence from European intrigues. Harding represented the conservative wing of the GOP in opposition to progressive followers of the late [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (who died in 1919) and Senator [[Robert M. LaFollette, Sr.]]  He defeated [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] and fellow Ohio newspaper publisher [[James M. Cox]] with the largest popular vote landslide (60% to 34%) in presidential history.

Harding sought out the "best minds" in his cabinet, including [[Andrew Mellon]] at the [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]], [[Herbert Hoover]] at [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], and [[Charles Evans Hughes]] at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. He rewarded friends and contributors, known as the "[[Ohio Gang]]", with powerful positions. Multiple cases of corruption were exposed during his presidency and after his death, including the notorious [[Teapot Dome scandal]], regarded in pre-[[Watergate]] times as the "greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/historynow/historian5.php|title=Graft and Oil: How Teapot Dome Became the Greatest Political Scandal of its Time|last=Cherny|first=Robert W.|work=History Now|publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]]|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref>

Domestically, Harding signed the first [[Sheppard-Towner Act|federal child welfare program]], and dealt with striking mining and railroad workers in part by supporting an 8-hour work day. He created the [[Bureau of the Budget]] to prepare the first [[United States federal budget]]. Harding advocated an anti-lynching bill to curb violence against African Americans, but it failed to pass Congress. In foreign affairs, Harding spurned the [[League of Nations]] and negotiated peace treaties with Germany and Austria.  His greatest foreign policy achievement came in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921–22, in which the world's major naval powers agreed on a naval limitations program that held sway for a decade. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

In August 1923, Harding suddenly collapsed and died in California. His administration's many scandals have earned Harding a [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|bottom-tier ranking]] from historians,<ref name=Ip274>Ingalls (1974), p 274</ref> but in recent years there has been some recognition of his fiscal responsibility and endorsement of African-American civil rights.<ref name=WQp62>''Wilson Quarterly'' (Winter 2012), "Harding's Hidden Halo"</ref> Harding has been viewed as a more modern politician who embraced technology and was sensitive to the plights of minorities, women, and labor.<ref>Anthony (July–August 1998), "The Most Scandalous President"</ref>

==Early life==

===Childhood and education===
[[File:Warren Harding c1882 age 17.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Harding, c. 1882]]
Warren Gamaliel Harding was born November 2, 1865, in [[Blooming Grove, Ohio]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 33.</ref> His paternal ancestors, mostly ardent Baptists, hailed from Clifford, Pennsylvania and migrated to Ohio in 1820.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 20.</ref> Nicknamed "Winnie", he was the eldest of eight children born to Dr. George Tryon Harding, Sr. (1843–1928) and Phoebe Elizabeth (Dickerson) Harding (1843–1910).<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 33.</ref> His mother's ancestors were [[Dutch people|Dutch]], including the well known Van Kirk family.<ref>{{cite book |title=The illustrious life and work of Warren G. Harding, twenty-ninth President of the United States |last=Russell |first=Thomas |pages=51 |year=1923 |publisher=the University of Wisconsin–Madison}}</ref> His mother, a devout Methodist, was a midwife who later obtained her medical license. His father, never quite content with his job or possessions, was forever swapping them for something better, and was usually in debt; he owned a farm, taught at a [[rural]] school north of [[Mount Gilead, Ohio]], and also acquired a medical degree and started a small practice.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 35.</ref> It was rumored in Blooming Grove that one of Harding's great-grandmothers might have been [[African American]].<ref name="Our First Black President?">Gage, Beverly [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/magazine/06wwln-essay-t.html?ref=warrengharding "Our First Black President?"], ''New York Times'', April 6, 2008, retrieved December 13, 2009 (login required as of May 15, 2014)</ref> Harding's great-great grandfather Amos claimed that a thief, who had been caught in the act by the family, started the rumor in an attempt at extortion.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 26.</ref> Harding's family eventually moved to [[Caledonia, Ohio]], where his father acquired ''The Argus'', a local weekly newspaper. It was at ''The Argus'' that Harding, from the age of 10, learned the basics of the journalism business. In 1878, his brother Charles and sister Persilla died, presumably from typhoid.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 43.</ref>

Harding continued to study the printing and newspaper trade as a college student at [[Ohio Central College]] in [[Iberia, Ohio|Iberia]]. At the same time, he worked at the ''Union Register'' in Mount Gilead.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 44.</ref> Harding became an accomplished public speaker in college, and graduated in 1882 at the age of 17 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree.<ref name="Warren G. Harding Biography">{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Judge Mark|last2=Harding III, M.D.|first2=Warren G.|title=Warren G.

The money paid for the band's snappy dress uniforms Harding had bought on credit.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 42; Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', p. 3</ref>

===Journalism career and marriage===
Upon graduating, Harding had stints as a teacher and insurance man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase the failing ''[[Marion Daily Star]]'', the weakest of the growing city's three newspapers. By 1886, he completely owned the ''Star''.<ref name="Warren G. Harding Biography"/><ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 51–55</ref> He revamped the paper's editorial platform to support the Republican Party and became an ardent supporter of Governor "Fire Alarm Joe" [[Joseph Foraker|Foraker]]. This political stance put him at odds with those who controlled local politics in Marion.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 56–68</ref> When Harding moved to unseat the ''Marion Independent'' as the official daily paper, he met with strong resistance from local figures, such as Amos Hall Kling, one of Marion's wealthiest real estate speculators. The editorial battle with the ''Independent'' became so heated that, at the inevitable mention of Harding's questionable bloodline, father and son brought a shotgun and demanded a retraction at gunpoint. They were successful.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 74</ref>
[[File:Florence Kling Harding-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Florence Harding]]
While Harding won the war of words and made the ''Marion Daily Star'' one of the most popular newspapers in the county, the battle took a toll on his health. In 1889, at age 24, he suffered from exhaustion and nervous fatigue. He spent several weeks at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] to regain his strength and ultimately made 5 visits over 14 years.<ref>Knott, Bill [http://www.adventistreview.org/issue.php?issue=2006-1503&page=8 "The Nearly Adventist President"], ''Adventist Review'', January 26, 2006, Retrieved November 28, 2007.</ref> Harding later returned to Marion to continue operating the paper. He spent his days promoting the community on the editorial pages, and his evenings "[[bloviation|bloviating]]" (a word Harding used frequently) with his friends over games of poker.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 80</ref> In 1893, the ''Star'' supplanted the ''Independent'' as the official paper for Marion's governmental notices, after Harding exposed the rival paper for overcharging the city.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 92.</ref> In 1896, the ''Independent'' ceased doing business and Amos Kling immediately financed and launched another rival paper, the ''Republican Transcript'', in a failed attempt to derail his son-in-law.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 99.</ref> Harding also made political speeches on the [[Chautauqua circuit]] and expressed admiration for his ideal American patron, [[Alexander Hamilton]].<ref name="Warren G. Harding Biography"/> He also is said to have originated the phrase "[[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Founding Fathers Reconsidered |last=Bernstein |first=R.B. |pages=4–5 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533832-4}}</ref>

In 1900, political opponent J.F. McNeal, with Amos Kling's help, secretly bought up $20,000 in loans owed by Harding, and immediately called them due in full. Harding just barely secured the funds to pay off the debt to save the ''Star''.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 138.</ref> In the last year of his Presidency, anticipating no resumption of his journalism career following his years in the White House, Harding sold the ''Star'' to Louis H. Brush and Roy D. Moore for $550,000.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 572.</ref>

On July 8, 1891 Harding married [[Florence Harding|Florence Kling DeWolfe]], the daughter of his nemesis Amos Hall Kling—who was also her nemesis. Florence Kling DeWolfe was a [[divorcee]], 5 years Harding's senior, and the mother of a young son, Marshall Eugene DeWolfe.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 82.</ref> Florence's father had soundly condemned her first—compulsory—marriage, to an alcoholic. He had disowned her, but her mother had remained loyal and supportive.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 82–83.</ref> She pursued Harding persistently, until he reluctantly proposed. According to noted biographer Russell, he was compelled to propose not so much because of true love, but of the prospect of social acceptance and standing.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 84.</ref> Incensed by his daughter's decision to marry Harding, he prohibited his wife from attending the wedding (she sneaked in long enough to see the vows exchanged) and refused to speak to his daughter or son-in-law for 8 years. Her mother continued to provide support on the sly.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 85.</ref>

The couple was complementary, with Harding's affable personality balancing his wife's no-nonsense approach to life. Florence Harding, exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, turned the ''Marion Daily Star'' into a profitable business in her management of the circulation.<ref name="Russell, p. 90">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 90.</ref> She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; some have speculated that she pushed him all the way to the White House.<ref>[[#Schlesinger|Schlesinger]], p. 50.</ref> Early in their marriage, Harding bestowed on her the lasting nickname "Duchess" as a nod to the imperious (and often alienating) persona she shared with her father.<ref name="Russell, p. 90"/>

==Early political career==

===Ohio emergence===
Harding made his foray into politics running for the Marion County Auditor's office, primarily to gain political exposure—his inability to win the election was a foregone conclusion in the heavily Democratic county.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 88.</ref> When his newspaper business attained sufficient economic stability, and even dominance, in Marion, Harding and his wife traveled widely throughout the country, which broadened Harding's exposure at political gatherings. Biographer Andrew Sinclair asserts that, like many contemporaries during the days of Ohio Republican Party boss [[Mark Hanna]], Harding was involved with graft and excessive patronage.<ref name="Sinclair, pp. 40-42">[[#Sinclair|Sinclair]], pp. 40–42.</ref> Harding allegedly arranged free public-transit passes for his family in return for favorable coverage in his newspaper.<ref name="Sinclair, pp. 40-42"/> Harding, in 1897, was said to have facilitated his sister's appointment as a teacher for the blind over supposedly more qualified candidates.<ref name="Sinclair, pp. 40-42"/> Harding was also accused of collusion with other newspapers on the [[price-fixing]] of public printing bids and dividing the profits from low-straw biddings.<ref name="Sinclair, pp. 40-42"/> No formal charges were made against Harding based on these accusations. The accomplished publisher also gained a flair for public speaking, and in 1899 Harding was elected to fill the Ohio State Senate seat for the 13th Senatorial District, despite Amos Kling's financing of a primary opponent.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 106.</ref> Shortly after this victory, there was a fortuitous meeting with Ohio Republican party leader and McKinley ally, [[Harry M. Daugherty]], who commented about him, "Gee, what a great looking President he'd make."; Daugherty later assumed the primary role in Harding's political career.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 109.</ref>
[[File:MAHanna.jpg|thumb|left|Harding's ally and Ohio political boss Mark Hanna]]
As a Republican state senator, Harding was a partisan regular and did favors for political bosses [[Mark Hanna]] and Harry M. Daugherty. Harding's only notable reform effort in his first term (Ohio state offices had 2-year terms) was a progressive bill to revamp the municipal code, which had passed the Senate but was halted by a single member's procedural call to "reconsider".<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 137.</ref> As asserted by Sinclair, Harding, against his own conscience, signed a municipal bill that protected Republican party patronage and graft.<ref name="Sinclair, pp. 40-42"/> In his second term, he was chosen Republican Floor Leader.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 142.</ref> In early 1903 Harding announced his campaign for [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor of Ohio]], which was soon thwarted by an intra-party alliance that assured the election of fellow Republican [[Myron T. Herrick]]; Harding was awarded the position of Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, a post he occupied from 1904 to 1906.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 148.</ref> In short order, a number of ill-advised decisions by Gov. Herrick damaged his popularity. As the 1906 election approached, Harding saw an opening and announced his candidacy for Governor again. Nevertheless, the party bosses stuck by Herrick, and Harding took his name out of the running for any position on the ticket, which was defeated by the Democrats.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 165.</ref>

While Harding was dwindling politically, there were developments on the personal and business front. In 1907, Amos Kling married his second wife and began an effort at rapprochement with daughter and son-in-law. As a result, the Klings and the Hardings took a cruise to Europe together.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 179.</ref> Soon after their return, Harding reorganized his newspaper business into the Harding Publishing Co., issued stock in the company, took two-thirds for himself and allowed his employees to purchase the rest; this was the first profit-sharing arrangement of its kind in Ohio.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 193.</ref>

Harding sought the 1909 gubernatorial nomination of the GOP, which was deeply divided between progressive and conservative wings of the party, but could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent [[Judson Harmon]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp.197, 208–210.</ref> Harding took his first election loss in stride, saying "...I have lost nothing which I ever had except a few dollars which I can make again, a few pounds of flesh which I can grow again, a few false friends of whom I am well rid, and an ambition which simply fettered my freedom and did not make for happiness."<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 214.</ref>

===U.S. Senator===
[[File:Senator Warren G. Harding 02.jpg|thumb|right|Warren G. Harding c.1919]]
In 1912, incumbent President [[William Howard Taft]] chose Harding, a talented [[orator|speaker]], to give Taft's nominating speech at the embattled Republican National Convention in Chicago.{{sfn|Nevins 1932|page=253}} <ref name=Russel_p224>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 224.</ref> Taft would later be nominated by President Harding, confirmed by the Senate, and served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court during Harding's administration.  Before Harding completed his introduction, a fist fight ensued between the Taft supporters and the more progressive Roosevelt faction, but his speech was  a personal success.<ref name=Russel_p224/>  By 1914 the Republican Party was beginning to show signs of reunification, so that support weakened for Ohio's U.S. Senator Theodore Burton, who then decided not to stand for re-election. When prompted, Harding agreed to run for Burton's seat against his mentor, "Fire Engine" Joe Foraker, in the Republican primary, and he emerged victorious.<ref name="Russell, p. 244">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 244.</ref> Henry Daugherty at this point was on a first name basis with Harding and supported his campaign. Harding's [[United States Senate election in Ohio, 1914|general election]] opponent, Timothy Hogan, fell victim to fervid anti-Catholic sentiment (which Harding did not voice). Having defeated Hogan, Harding became Ohio's first U.S. Senator [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].  The 1914 general election came on the heels of the outbreak of World War I—an issue Harding downplayed due to the significant German immigrant population in his district.<ref name="Russell, p. 244"/> He served in the Senate from 1915 until his inauguration as President in 1921, making him the first sitting senator to be elected President of the United States; [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Barack Obama]] followed in this pattern. ([[James A. Garfield]] was at the time of his presidential election a non-incumbent senator-elect.)

When Harding joined the U.S. Congress, the Democrats controlled the Senate and House of Representatives, led by a progressive Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]; the opposition dominated the legislative agenda. Harding was often considered a fence sitter on most issues, be that labor, big business, women's suffrage, or prohibition. He was "the harmonizer", declaring that a "righteous mean" could always be obtained on an issue. He did vote on legislation to protect the [[alcohol]] industry 30 times and was against [[Philippine]] independence.<ref>[[#Sinclair|Sinclair]], pp. 61, 62</ref> He was staunchly opposed to government ownership of business.<ref name="Sinclair pp. 61, 62">Sinclair pp. 61, 62</ref> In startling form, he once spoke in support of a strong executive, at least in wartime, saying about President Wilson, "He is already&nbsp;... our partial dictator. Why not make him complete and supreme dictator?"<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 295.</ref> He joined with 39 other senators in opposition to Wilson's proposed League of Nations.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 317.</ref> Harding took on a personal secretary in the Senate, George B. Christian, Jr., a former neighbor, who protected him from political patrons and intrusive inquiries, and served until the future president's death.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 255.</ref> Harding introduced 134 bills, but substantively his six-year record as Senator was unremarkable; his attendance was inconsistent, he spoke minimally on the floor of the Senate and offered no major bill or debate. Harding was not even present for the vote on the women's suffrage amendment, though he "paired" his vote with another member, in effect supporting it.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 319.</ref> He was nevertheless popular and acquired many very close friends in the chamber.<ref name="Sinclair pp. 61, 62"/><ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 259.</ref> This popularity led to his serving as Chairman of the 1916 Republican Convention as well as Keynote Speaker.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 271.</ref>

==Presidential election of 1920==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1920}}

===Republican nomination===
In 1918, when Theodore Roosevelt was entertaining plans (later abandoned) to reprise his presidency, he considered Harding had strong potential to run and serve as Vice President, and discussed with Harry Daugherty the desirability of having Harding on his ticket.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 302.</ref> In 1919, the first candidate to declare for the GOP nomination was General [[Leonard Wood]]. The GOP bosses were nevertheless determined to have a dependable listener, and were lukewarm toward the General.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p.327.</ref> Some in the party began to scout for such an alternative, and Harding's name arose, despite his reluctance, due to his unique ability to draw vital Ohio votes.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 328.</ref> Also at the forefront of a throng of candidates for the nomination were [[Hiram Johnson]], [[Frank Lowden]] and [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 334.</ref> Harry Daugherty, who became Harding's campaign manager, and who was sure none of these candidates could garner a majority, convinced Harding to run after a marathon discussion of six-plus hours.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 333.</ref> Daugherty's campaign style was variously described as pugnacious, devious and no holds barred.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p.339.</ref> For example, shortly before the GOP convention, Daugherty struck a deal with millionaire and political opportunist Jake Hamon, whereby 18 Oklahoma delegates whose votes Hamon had bought for Lowden were committed to Harding as a second choice if Lowden's effort faltered.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 348.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/site/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleid=070731_1_A4_spanc15888 |title=Only in Oklahoma: Hamon's death spawned sensational trial |first=Gene |last=Curtis |newspaper=Tulsa World |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2013 }}</ref>

Harding's supporters thought of him as the next McKinley. By the time the convention began, a Senate sub-committee had tallied the monies spent by the various candidates, with totals as follows: Wood—$1.8&nbsp;million; Lowden—$414,000; Johnson—$194,000; and Harding—$114,000; the committed delegate count at the opening gavel was: Wood—124; Johnson—112; Lowden—72; Harding—39.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 351.</ref> Still, at the opening, less than one-half of the delegates were committed.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 356.</ref> No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 380.</ref> Republican Senators and other leaders, who were divided without a singular political boss, met in Room 404 of the [[Blackstone Hotel]] in Chicago and after a nightlong session, tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate. According to Francis Russell, though additional meetings took place, this particular meeting came to be known as the "smoke filled room".<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 381.</ref> Before Harding received the formal nod, George Harvey summoned him. Harvey told him he was considered the consensus nominee, and asked if he knew, "before God," whether anything in his life would be an impediment. After mulling the question over for some minutes, Harding replied no, despite his alleged adulterous affairs.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 382.</ref> The next day, when Harding was nominated on the tenth ballot, Mrs. Harding was so startled, she inadvertently stabbed Harry Daugherty in the side with her hatpins.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 394.</ref> The local Masons could not resist the opportunity to co-opt Harding's new status, and promoted him to the Sublime Degree of a [[Master Mason]].<ref>[[#Sinclair|Sinclair]], pp. 122–130.</ref>

===General election===

In the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 election]], Harding ran against Democratic Ohio Governor James M. Cox, whose running mate was [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The election theme became a rejection of the [[Progressive Era|"progressive"]] ideology of the Woodrow Wilson Administration in favor of the "[[laissez-faire]]" approach of the [[William McKinley]] era.<ref name="Russell, p. 404">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 404.</ref>

Harding ran on a promise to "Return to Normalcy", a seldom-used term he popularized, and healing for the nation after World War I. The policy called for an end to the abnormal era of [[World War I|the Great War]], along with a call to reflect three trends of the time: a renewed [[isolationism]] in reaction to the War, a resurgence of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], and a turning away from government activism.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 403.</ref>

On July 28, 1920, Harding's aide [[Albert Lasker]], a top advertising executive from Chicago, unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used modern advertising techniques for the first time in a presidential campaign.<ref>John A. Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)</ref> Lasker's approach included newsreels and sound recordings, all in an effort to enhance Harding's patriotism and affability. Farmers were sent brochures decrying the alleged abuses of Democratic agriculture policies. African Americans and women were also given literature in an attempt to take away votes from the Democrats. Professional advertisers including Chicagoan Albert Tucker were consulted. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Five thousand speakers were trained by advertiser [[Harry New]] and sent abroad to speak for Harding; 2,000 of these speakers were women. [[Telemarketers]] were used to make phone conferences with perfected dialogues to promote Harding. Lasker had 8,000 photos distributed around the nation every two weeks of Harding and his wife.<ref>[[#Morello|Morello]], pp. 64-65</ref>
[[Image:WGHarding.jpg|thumb|Warren G. Harding campaigning in 1920]]

Lasker designed the "front porch campaign" during the late summer and fall of 1920 that put Harding's name and image everywhere. It was the first front porch campaign since McKinley in 1896, and  the first to receive widespread newsreel coverage. It was also the first modern campaign to use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars, who travelled to Marion for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife. [[Al Jolson]], [[Lillian Russell]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[Mary Pickford]] were among the luminaries to make the pilgrimage to [[Harding Home|his house]] in central Ohio. Business icons [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[Harvey Firestone]] also lent their cachet to the campaign. From the onset of the campaign until the November election, over 600,000 people travelled to Marion to participate.

The campaign owed a great deal to Florence Harding, who played a more active role than the wives of previous candidates had. She cultivated the relationship between the campaign and the press. As the business manager of the ''Star'', she understood reporters and their industry. She played to their needs by being available to answer questions, pose for pictures, or deliver food from her kitchen to the press office—a bungalow that she had constructed at the rear of their property in Marion. Mrs. Harding even coached her husband on the proper way to wave to newsreel cameras to make the most of coverage. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

Campaign manager Lasker struck a deal with Harding's paramour, Carrie Phillips, and her husband Jim Phillips, whereby the couple agreed to leave the country until after the election. Ostensibly, Mr. Phillips was to investigate the silk trade.<ref name="Russell, p. 405">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 405.</ref>

The campaign also drew on Harding's popularity with women. Considered handsome, Harding photographed well compared to Cox. However, it was mainly Harding's Senate support for [[women's suffrage]] legislation that made him popular in that demographic. Ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] in August 1920 brought huge crowds of women to Marion, Ohio to hear Harding speak. Immigrant groups such as ethnic [[German Americans]] and [[Irish Americans]], who made up an important part of the Democratic coalition, also voted for Harding, in reaction to the nation's [[Woodrow Wilson#Home front|persecution of the Germans]] during and after the war and Wilson's retraction of support for Irish independence.

The 1920 election was the first in which women could vote nationwide, and the first to be covered on the radio, thanks to [[KDKA (AM)#History|KDKA ("8ZZ")]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 8MK (later [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]]) in Detroit, and the educational and amateur radio station 1XE (later WGI) at Medford Hillside, Massachusetts&nbsp;– all of which carried the election returns. Harding received 60% of the national vote, the highest percentage ever recorded up to that time, and 404 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s. Cox received 34% of the national vote and 127 electoral votes.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 418.</ref> Campaigning from a federal prison, [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] [[Eugene V.

===African-American lineage contention===
During the campaign, Democratic opponents spread rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a [[West Indian]] [[black person]] and that other [[African-American heritage of United States presidents|blacks might be found in his family tree]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 372.</ref> In an era when the "[[one-drop rule]]" would classify a person with any African ancestry as black, and black people in [[Southern United States|the South]] had been effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]], Harding's campaign manager responded, "No family in the state (of Ohio) has a clearer, a more honorable record than the Hardings', a blue-eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood."<ref name="Russell, p. 404"/> 

Historian and opponent [[William Estabrook Chancellor]] publicized the rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 403–05.</ref> The rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman [[James W. Faulkner]] on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: "How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence."<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 280.</ref> However, while there are gaps in the historical record, studies of his family tree have not found evidence of an African-American ancestor.<ref>Gloria Millner, [http://blog.cleveland.com/pdopinion/2008/02/warren_g_hardings_roots_and_ra.html Warren G.

[[File:Warren G. Harding inauguration cph.3b11806.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of Warren G. Harding, March 4, 1921.]]
Harding preferred a low-key inauguration, without the customary parade, leaving only the swearing-in ceremony and a brief reception at the White House.  In his inaugural speech he declared, "Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much from the government and at the same time do too little for it."<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 2, 14.</ref>  Literary critic [[H.L. Mencken]] was appalled, announcing  that:
:He writes the worst English I have ever encountered. It reminds me of a string of wet sponges; it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Metcalf|title=Presidential Voices: Speaking Styles from George Washington to George W. Bush|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dh0wM9DNjbAC&pg=PA37|year=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|pages=37–38}}</ref> The Hardings brought a different style to the running of the White House. Though Mrs. Harding did keep a little red book of those who had offended her, the executive mansion was now once again open to the public, including the annual Easter egg roll.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 437.</ref>

Harding's administration followed the Republican [[Party platform|national platform]]. Energized by his landslide, Harding felt the "pulse" of the nation and for the 28 months in office he remained popular both nationally and internationally. Harding's administration has been critically viewed due to multiple scandals, while his successes in office were often given credit to his capable cabinet appointments that included future President [[Herbert Hoover]]. Author Wayne Lutton asked, "Was Harding really a failure?", citing former Watergate persona [[John Dean]], who grew up near Harding's home, as saying Harding's accomplishments included income tax and federal spending reductions, economic policies that reduced "[[stagflation]]", a reduction of unemployment by 10%, and a bold foreign policy that created peace with Germany, Japan, and Central America,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lutton|first=Wayne|title=Warren Harding: One of Our Most Accomplished Presidents?| magazine=Human Events, December 27, 2004, vol. 60, issue 44, p. 18}}</ref> although Dean's work itself only cites a "slight decline in unemployment figures" and does not mention "stagflation" at all.<ref>[[#Dean|Dean]], p. 115.</ref> Herbert Hoover, while serving in Harding's cabinet, was confident the President would serve two terms and return the world to normalcy. Later, in his own memoirs, he stated that Harding had "neither the experience nor the intellect that the position needed."<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 462.</ref>
[[File:Wharding.jpeg|thumb|<center>President Warren G. Harding<br />1921–1923<br />Official White House Portrait</center>]]
One of Harding's most important decisions was the appointment of former President [[William Howard Taft]] as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a position Taft had always coveted, more so than the Presidency.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 442.</ref>

Harding pushed for the establishment of the Bureau of Veterans Affairs (later organized as the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]), the first permanent attempt at answering the needs of those who had served the nation in time of war.<ref>[[#Graff|Graff]], pp. 394–398</ref> In April 1921, Harding spoke before a special joint session of Congress that he had called. He argued for peacemaking with Germany and Austria, emergency [[tariff]]s, new immigration laws, regulation of radio and trans-cable communications, retrenchment in government, tax reduction, repeal of wartime excess profits tax, reduction of railroad rates, promotion of agricultural interests, a national budget system, an enlarged [[merchant marine]], and a department of public welfare.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 456.</ref> He also called for measures to end [[lynching]], but not wanting to make enemies in his own party and with the Democrats, he did not fight for his program.<ref>Murray (1969)</ref> Generally, there was a lack of strong leadership in the Congress and, unlike his predecessors Roosevelt and Wilson, Harding was not inclined to fill that void.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 457.</ref>

According to biographers, Harding got along better with the press than any other previous President, being a former newspaperman. Reporters admired his frankness, candor, and his confessed limitations. He took the press behind the scenes and showed them the inner circle of the presidency. Harding, in November 1921, also implemented a policy of taking written questions from reporters during a press conference.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Dean|Dean]], pp. 95, 97, 99, 100.</ref> Harding's relationship with Congress, however, was strained and he did not receive the traditional honeymoon given to new Presidents. Before Harding's election, the nation had been adrift; President Woodrow Wilson had been ill by a debilitating stroke for 18 months and before that Wilson had been in Europe for several months attempting to negotiate a peace settlement after World War I. By contrast, at the March 4, 1921 Inaugural, Harding looked strong, with grey hair and a commanding physical presence.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Wilson's successor stressed the importance of the ceremonial aspects of the office of President. This emphasis fulfilled his desire to travel the breadth of the country to officiate at formal functions.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 453.</ref>

Although Harding was committed to putting the "best minds" on his cabinet, he often rewarded those persons who were active and contributed to his campaign by appointing them to high federal department positions. Wayne Wheeler, leader of the Anti-Saloon League, was allowed by Harding to dictate who would serve on the Prohibition Commission.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 440.</ref> Graft and corruption charges permeated Harding's [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]; bootleggers [[confiscated]] tens of thousands cases of whiskey through [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]].<ref name="Werner, pp. 266–272">[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 266–272.</ref> Harding, out of loyalty, appointed [[Harry M. Daugherty]] to [[U.S. Attorney General]] because he felt he owed Daugherty for running his 1920 campaign. After the election, many people from the Ohio area moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], made their headquarters in a green house on K Street, and would be eventually known as the "Ohio Gang".<ref>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=3033 Harry M. Daugherty], Ohio History Central, Retrieved September 5, 2010</ref> The financial and political scandals caused by these men, in addition to Harding's own personal controversies, severely damaged Harding's personal reputation and eclipsed his presidential accomplishments. In his most open challenge to Congress, Harding forced a deferral of a budget-busting World War I soldier's bonus in an effort to reduce costs.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 460.</ref>

A 2008 study of presidential rankings for ''[[The Times]]'' placed Harding at number 34<ref>Griffin, J.; Hines, N. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5030539.ece Presidential Rankings], London ''Sunday Times'', October 28, 2008, Retrieved November 24, 2010</ref> and a 2009 [[C-SPAN]] survey ranked Harding at 38.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/Overall-Ranking.aspx | title = C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leadership |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090217053502/http://www.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/Overall-Ranking.aspx |archivedate= February 17, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, a ''[[Siena College]]'' poll of Presidential scholars placed Harding at 41.

Harding presided over the nation's initial consecration of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This followed similar commemorations established by Britain, France and Italy. The fallen hero was chosen from a group previously interred at Romagne Military Cemetery in France, and was re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery.
[[image:Eugenedebs1921.jpg|thumb |200px |right |Eugene Debs after release from prison by President Harding, visits the White House]]
On December 23, 1921 Harding calmed the [[First Red Scare|1919–1920 Bolshevik scare]], and released an election opponent, socialist leader [[Eugene Debs]], from prison. This was part of an effort to return the United States to normalcy after the Great War. Debs, a forceful World War I antiwar activist, had been convicted under sedition charges brought by the Wilson administration for his opposition to the draft during World War I.<ref>[[#Frum|Frum]], p. 41.</ref> Despite many political differences between the two candidates Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served; however, he was not granted an official [[Presidential pardon]]. Debs' failing health was a contributing factor for the release. Harding granted a general amnesty to 23 prisoners, alleged [[anarchists]] and [[socialists]], active in the [[Red Scare]].<ref name="Graff, pp. 394–398">[[#Graff|Graff]], pp. 394–398</ref><ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 487.</ref>

The Hardings visited their home community of Marion, Ohio, once during the term, when the city celebrated its centennial during the first week of July. Harding arrived on July 3, gave a speech to the community at the [[Marion County, Ohio|Marion County]] Fairgrounds on July 4, and left the following morning for other speaking commitments.

===Joint Session of Congress 1921===
On April 12, Harding called a joint session of Congress to address matters that he deemed of national and urgent importance. That speech, considered his best, contained few political platitudes and was enthusiastically received by Congress. On the economic front, Harding urged Congress to create a Bureau of the Budget, cut expenditures, and revise federal tax laws. Harding urged increased protectionist [[tariffs]], lower taxes, and agriculture legislation to help farmers. In the speech, Harding advocated aviation technology for civil and military purposes, development and regulation of radio technology, and passage of a federal anti-lynching law to protect African Americans. Harding advocated, in terms of foreign affairs, a "conference and cooperation" of nations to prevent war—yet flatly stated that the U.S. should not enter the League of Nations. Harding endorsed peace between all former enemy nations from World War I and the funding and liquidation of war debts.<ref>Graff, pp. 394–398".</ref>

===Domestic policies and economy===
====Bureau of the Budget and Veterans Bureau====
[[File:Chas G Dawes-H&E.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Dawes]]—the first budget director]]
Harding signed the [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]], considered one of his greatest domestic and enduring achievements.<ref>History Channel (2005), ''The Presidents'', Part 6, Segment 2/5.</ref> Harding got authorization from Congress for the country's first formal budgeting process—establishing of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 443.</ref> The law created the presidential budget director, who was directly responsible to the President rather than to the [[United States Secretary of Treasury|Secretary of Treasury]]. The law also stipulated that the President must submit a budget annually to the U.S. Congress. All presidents since have had to submit an annual budget to Congress.<ref>History Channel (2005), ''The Presidents'', Part 6, Section 2/5.</ref> The [[General Accounting Office]] was created to assure oversight in the federal budget expenditures. Harding appointed [[Charles Dawes]], known for being an effective financier, as the first director of the Bureau of the Budget. Dawes reduced government spending by $1.5 billion his first year as director, a 25% reduction, along with another 25% reduction the following year. In effect, the Government budget was nearly cut in half in just two years.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 538.</ref>

Harding believed the federal government should be fiscally managed in a way similar to private sector businesses. He had campaigned on the slogan, "Less government in business and more business in government."<ref>{{cite web|title=Warren G. Harding US President&nbsp;— 1921–23|url=http://www.classbrain.com/artbiographies/publish/warren_harding.shtml|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> "Harding was true to his word, carrying on budget cuts that had begun under a debilitated Woodrow Wilson. Federal spending declined from $6.3 billion in 1920 to $5 billion in 1921 and $3.3 billion in 1922. Tax rates, meanwhile, were slashed—for every income group. And over the course of the 1920s, the national debt was reduced by one third."<ref name="Woods"/>

On August 9, 1921, Harding signed legislation known as the Sweet Bill, which established the Veterans Bureau as a new agency. After World War I, 300,000 wounded veterans were in need of [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]], medical care, and job training. To handle the needs of these veterans, the new Veterans Bureau incorporated the War Risk Insurance Bureau, the Brig. Gen. [[Charles E. Sawyer]]'s Federal Hospitalization Bureau, along with three other bureaus that dealt with veteran affairs.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 522.</ref> Harding regrettably appointed Colonel [[Charles R. Forbes]], albeit a decorated war veteran, as the Veteran Bureau's first director (see scandal below), a position that reported directly to the President. The Veterans Bureau later was incorporated into the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] and ultimately the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 526.</ref>

====Postwar recession and recovery====
{{Main|Depression of 1920–21}}
[[File:AWMellon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Secretary of Treasury [[Andrew W. Mellon]]]]
On March 4, Harding assumed office while the nation was in the midst of a postwar economic decline, known as the [[Depression of 1920–21]]. By summer of his first year in office, an economic recovery began. He convened the Conference of Unemployment in 1921, headed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, that proactively advocated stimulating the economy with local public work projects and encouraged businesses to apply shared work programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conference on Unemployment|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924032446498#page/n1/mode/2up|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}</ref> Harding's Treasury Secretary, [[Andrew Mellon]], ordered a study that claimed to demonstrate that as income tax rates were increased, money was driven underground or abroad. Mellon concluded that lower rates would increase tax revenues. Based on this advice, Harding cut taxes, starting in 1922. The top marginal rate was reduced annually in four stages from 73% in 1921 to 25% in 1925. Taxes were cut for lower incomes starting in 1923.<ref>{{cite web|author=Internal Revenue Service|title=Table 23.

Daniel Kuehn {{Who|date=October 2014}} has attributed the improvement to the earlier monetary policy of the [[Federal Reserve]], and notes that the changes in marginal tax rates were accompanied by an expansion in the tax base that could account for the increase in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/5683j4v650187261|title=A critique of Powell, Woods, and Murphy on the 1920–1921 depression|doi=10.1007/s11138-010-0131-3|publisher=Springerlink.com|accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref>

[[Robert J. Gordon|Robert Gordon]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]], notes, "government policy to moderate the depression and speed recovery was minimal. The Federal Reserve authorities were largely passive. ...&nbsp;Despite the absence of a stimulative government policy, however, recovery was not long delayed." Kenneth Weiher, an economic historian, notes, "despite the severity of the contraction, the Fed did not move to use its powers to turn the money supply around and fight the contraction." He concedes that "the economy rebounded quickly from the 1920–1921 depression and entered a period of quite vigorous growth."<ref name="Woods"/> [[Paul Krugman]] argues that the monetary base expanded significantly from 1922 to 1925, and that this expansion was accompanied by a reduction in commercial paper rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/1921-and-all-that|title=1921 and All That|date=April 1, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref> Allan Meltzer agrees that the rising real money stock motivated wealth owners to invest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tepper.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/gsia/meltzer/Munich.PDF|title=Lessons from the Early History of the Federal Reserve|last=Metzger|first=Allan|date=March 17, 2000|authorlink=Allan Meltzer|format=PDF|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref> Recovery did not last long.

====Farm acts and Radio Conferences====
[[File:HerbertClarkHoover.jpg|thumb|200px|Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover listening to a radio]]
In 1921 and 1922, Harding signed a series of bills regulating agriculture. The legislation emanated from President Woodrow Wilson's 1919 [[Federal Trade Commission]] report, which investigated and discovered "manipulations, controls, trusts, combinations, or restraints out of harmony with the law or the public interest" in the meat packing industry. The first law was the [[Packers and Stockyards Act]], prohibiting packers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices. Two amendments were made to the [[Federal Farm Loan Act|Farm Loan Act]] of 1916 that President Wilson had signed into law, which had expanded the maximum size of rural farm loans. The Emergency Agriculture Credit Act authorized new loans to farmers to help them sell and market livestock. The [[Capper–Volstead Act]], signed by Harding on February 18, 1922, protected farm cooperatives from anti-trust legislation. The [[Future Trading Act]] was also enacted, regulating ''puts and calls'', ''bids'', and ''offers'' on [[futures contracts|futures contracting]]. Later, on May 15, 1922, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled this legislation unconstitutional.<ref name="Graff, pp. 394–398"/>

On February 27, 1922, Harding implemented the first of a series of Radio Conferences headed by [[Secretary of Commerce]] Herbert Hoover. The last [[Radio Act of 1912]] was considered "inadequate" and "chaotic"; change was necessary to help the fledgling radio industry. At the first meeting, 30 representatives—including amateurs, governmental agencies, and the radio industry made "cooperative efforts" to ensure the public interest in broadcasting, who would broadcast, and for what purpose, and to curb direct advertising. Also discussed was how wattage power used by broadcasters would be distributed depending on the radio station's conditional use and location.<ref name="Benjamin2006">{{cite book|author=Louise M.

A second radio conference was called in 1923, and this time Secretary Hoover successful obtained radio regulation power without legislation. Hoover himself, in January 1923, told the press there was an, "...urgent need for radio regulation." Large radio stations such as [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] advocated that only 25 larger radio stations in large [[metropolitan area]]s be allowed to broadcast, while smaller stations would be given limited power. At the end of the meeting, the industrialists agreed to give Hoover the power to, "...regulate hours and wave lengths of operation of stations when such action is necessary to prevent interference detrimental to the public good."<ref name="Benjamin2006"/>

Harding became the first president to have a radio in his office, when on February 8, 1922, he had a radio set installed in the [[White House]] so he could listen to news and music as his schedule permitted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today In History|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1502501&lang=eng_news|date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> On June 14, Harding was also the first president that the American public heard on the new mass medium. He spoke on radio at a dedication site in honor of [[Francis Scott Key]], who wrote the words to the ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]''.<ref name="history"/>

====Revenue Act and Highway Act of 1921====
[[File:Ford, Edison, Harding, and Firestone, New York Times, 1921.JPG|thumb|Left to right, [[Henry Ford]], [[Thomas Edison]], Harding, and [[Harvey Firestone]], 1921]]
On November 22, 1921, Harding signed the [[Revenue Act of 1921]], which greatly reduced taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Protests from Republican farmers caused the deductions to be less than Secretary of Treasury [[Andrew Mellon]] desired. The lengthy 96-page Act reduced the corporate tax from 65% to 50% and provided for ultimate elimination of the excess-profits tax during World War I.<ref name="Graff, pp. 394-398">[[#Graff|Graff]], pp. 394–398.</ref><ref>[[#Armstrong|Armstrong]], pp. 218–219</ref>

The 1920s were a time of modernization for America—with the advent of [[movies]], [[flappers]], and [[automobiles]]. To improve and expand the nation's highway system, Harding signed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Highway Act of 1921]]. From 1921 to 1923, the federal government spent $162&nbsp;million on America's highway system, infusing the U.S. economy with a large amount of capital.<ref>[[#Wynn|Wynn]], pp. 217-18.</ref> In 1922, Harding proclaimed that America was in the age of the "[[motor car]]". He stated that the automobile, "reflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present-day life."<ref>{{cite web|title=Second Annual Message|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29563|date=December 8, 1922|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

====Fordney–McCumber Tariff====
On September 21, 1922, Harding enthusiastically signed the [[Fordney–McCumber Tariff]] Act.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 550.</ref> The protectionist legislation was sponsored by Representative [[Joseph W. Fordney]] and Senator [[Porter J. McCumber]]. It increased the tariff rates contained in the previous [[Underwood-Simmons Tariff]] Act of 1913, to the highest level in the nation's history. Harding became concerned when the agriculture business suffered economic hardship from the high tariffs. Previously, on May 21, 1921 Harding had signed emergency legislation that put tariffs on select foreign inputs. By 1922, Harding began to realize that the long-term effects of tariffs could be detrimental to national economy, despite the short-term benefits.<ref name="Russell, pp. 551"/> His successors, Coolidge and Hoover, advocated tariff legislation. The tariffs established in the 1920s have historically been viewed as a contributing factor to causing the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name="Graff, pp. 394–398"/><ref>[[#Dean|Dean]], pp. 102–105.</ref>

===Foreign policies===
Harding was very specific in commenting on the appointment of Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes|Charles E. Hughes]], that the secretary would be the sole spokesman for the State Department (as opposed to the Wilson administration).<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 433.</ref> The U.S. Senate had refused to ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in both 1919 and 1920 because it required the U.S. to endorse the League of Nations.<ref>Graff, pp. 394–398.</ref> Hughes worked behind the scenes to formally make peace with Germany and the [[successor state]]s to Austria-Hungary, Austria and Hungary. This began with the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]]. The [[U.S.–German Peace Treaty (1921)|U.S.–German Peace Treaty]], [[U.S.–Austrian Peace Treaty (1921)|U.S.–Austrian Peace Treaty]] and [[U.S.–Hungarian Peace Treaty (1921)|U.S.–Hungarian Peace Treaty]] were ratified in 1921.

====Washington arms conference and treaties 1921–1922====
{{Main|Washington Naval Conference}}
[[File:Charles Evans Hughes-01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Charles Evans Hughes]], former Supreme Court Justice and Harding's Secretary of State]]
Harding spearheaded, with the urging of the Senate, a monumental global conference, held in [[Washington, D.C.]], to limit the armaments of world powers, including the U.S., Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, China, Belgium, Netherlands and Portugal.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 480.</ref> Harding's Secretary of State, [[Charles Evans Hughes|Charles E. Hughes]], assumed a primary role in the conference and made the pivotal proposal—the U.S would reduce its number of warships by 30 if Great Britain decommissioned 19, and Japan 17 ships.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 481.</ref> Starting on November 6, 1921 and ending February 6, 1922, world leaders met to control a naval arms race and to bring stability to [[East Asia]]. The conference enabled the great powers to potentially limit their large naval deployment and avoid conflict in the Pacific. The delegation of nations also worked out security issues and promoted cooperation in the Far East.

The conference produced six treaties and twelve resolutions among the participating nations, which ranged from limiting the size or "tonnage" of naval ships to custom tariffs. The treaties, which easily passed the Senate, also included agreements regulating submarines, dominions in the Pacific, and dealings with China.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 483.</ref> The treaties only remained in effect until the mid-1930s, however, and ultimately failed. Japan eventually invaded [[Manchuria]] and the arms limitations no longer had any effect. The building of "monster warships" resumed and the U.S. and Great Britain were unable to quickly rearm themselves to defend an international order and stop Japan from remilitarizing.<ref>Goldstein, Erik [http://books.google.com/?id=dDmJPPGjfJMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Washington+Conference,+1921-22 The Washington Conference 1921–22], 1994, Retrieved May 14, 2010.</ref><ref>Goldman, Emily O.

Harding, in an effort to improve U.S. relations with Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean Islands implemented a program of military disengagement. On April 20, 1921, the [[Thomson–Urrutia Treaty]] with Colombia was ratified by the Senate and signed by Harding; that awarded $25,000,000 as indemnity payment for land used to make the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name="Graff, pp. 394-398"/>

Harding stunned the capital when he sent to the Senate a message supporting the participation of the U.S. in the proposed [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. This was not favorably received by Harding's colleagues; a resolution was nevertheless drafted, in deference to the President, and then promptly buried in the Foreign Affairs Committee.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 560.</ref>

===Civil rights, labor disputes and strikes===
When the governor of West Virginia  [[Ephraim Morgan]] in 1921 requested federal troops to stop miners who were battling state police and militia, Harding issued two proclamations to keep the peace. Finally he sent in an Army unit who ended the mini-war.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shogan|first=Robert|title=The Battle of Blair Mountain|year=2004|page=117|publisher=Westview Press|place=Boulder|isbn=978-0-8133-4096-8}}</ref>

====Great railway strike and repeal of 12-hour workday====
{{Main|Great Railroad Strike of 1922}}
A year after Harding contended with the 1921 mining labor war in West Virginia, a strike broke out during the summer of 1922 in the railroad industry. On July 1, 1922, 400,000 railroad workers and shopmen went on strike over hourly wages reduced by seven cents and a 12&nbsp;hour-day workweek.<ref name="Russell, pp. 546">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 546.</ref> Strike busters were brought in to fill the positions. Harding proposed a settlement that gave the shop workers some concessions; however, the railroad owners objected. Harding sent out the National Guard and 2,200 deputy U.S. marshals to keep the peace. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge [[James H. Wilkerson]] to issue a broad sweeping injunction to break up the strike.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 547.</ref> This was known as the "Wilkerson" or "Daugherty" injunction, which enraged the union as well as many in congress, as it prohibited First Amendment rights.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 548.</ref> Harding had Daugherty and Wilkerson withdraw the objectionable parts of the injunction. The injunction ultimately succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and company men for years. Daugherty's harsh injunction against labor created great discord in Harding's cabinet. This, along with Daugherty's other activities, prompted one [[Minnesota]] congressman, [[Oscar Keller]], to unsuccessfully attempt to bring impeachment charges against the Attorney General.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 549.</ref>

In 1922, Harding and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover convened a White House conference with manufacturers and unions, to reduce the length of the 12-hour workday, in a move for the cause of labor. The labor movement supported an 8-hour day and a 6-day workweek. Harding wrote [[Judge Gary]], head of US Steel, advocating labor reform. The labor conference, however, decided against labor's demands in 1923. Both Harding and Hoover were disappointed with the committee's ruling. Harding wrote a second letter to Gary and with public support the steel industry repealed the 12-hour work day to an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 553.</ref>

====Anti-lynching movement and immigration====
[[File:Leonidas C. Dyer Edited.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Leonidas C. Dyer]]]]
Notably in an age of severe racial intolerance during the 1920s, Harding did not hold any racial [[wikt:animosity|animosity]], according to historian Carl S. Anthony.<ref name="Anthony 1998">Anthony (July–August, 1998), ''The Most Scandalous President''</ref> In a speech on October 26, 1921, given in  segregated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] Harding advocated [[civil rights]] for African Americans; the first President to openly advocate black political, educational, and economic equality during the 20th century.<ref name="Anthony 1998"/> In the "Birmingham speech," Harding wanted African Americans to have equal educational opportunities and greater voting rights in the South.  The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section of the segregated audience cheered.<ref>{{cite news |last=Radosh |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Radosh |last2=Radosh |first2=Allis |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2014/07/warren_harding_letters_could_they_spark_a_revisionist_view_of_the_much_maligned.single.html |title=What If Warren Harding Wasn’t a Terrible President? |work=Slate |date=2014-07-16 |accessdate=2014-07-18 }}</ref> Harding went further and viewed the race problem as a national and international issue and desired that the sectionalism of the Solid South and black membership of the Republican party be broken up.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor 1921">Christian Science Monitor (October 27, 1921), ''The President's Views On Race''</ref>  Harding, however, openly stated that he was not for black social equality in terms of racial mixing or [[miscegenation]].<ref name="Christian Science Monitor 1921"/>  Harding also spoke on the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], believing that blacks migrating to the north and west to find employment had actually tempered race relations between blacks and whites.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor 1921"/>

He named some African Americans to federal positions, such as [[Walter L. Cohen]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], Louisiana, whom he named comptroller of customs.  Harding also advocated the establishment of an international commission to improve race relations between whites and blacks; however, strong political opposition by the Southern Democratic bloc prevented the commission. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] had its highest membership during its revival in the early 1920s.

Harding supported Congressman [[Leonidas Dyer]]'s federal anti-lynching bill, known as the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill|Dyer Bill]], which passed the House of Representatives on January 26, 1922. The bill was defeated in the Senate by a Democratic [[filibuster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm|title=Anti-Lynching Bill|author=Leonidas Dyer|year=1922|publisher=WASM|accessdate=November 14, 2009}}{{cite web|url=http://www.marionhistory.com/wgharding/harding-2.htm|title=Warren G.

Congress had not debated a civil rights bill since the 1890 [[Lodge Bill|Federal Elections Bill]]. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

The Per Centum Act of 1921 signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3% of a country's represented population based on the 1910 census. The Act allowed unauthorized immigrants to be deported. Harding and Secretary of Labor [[James J. Davis|James Davis]] believed that enforcement had to be humane. Harding often allowed exceptions granting reprieves to thousands of immigrants.<ref>[[#Dean|Dean]], p. 102.</ref>

====Sheppard–Towner Maternity Act====
On November 21, 1921, Harding signed the [[Sheppard–Towner Act|Sheppard–Towner Maternity Act]], the first major federal government social welfare program in the U.S. The law funded almost 3,000 child and health centers throughout the U.S. Medical doctors were spurred to offer preventative health care measures in addition to treating ill children. Doctors were required to help healthy pregnant women and prevent healthy children from getting sick. Child welfare workers were sent out to make sure that parents were taking care of their children.  The law was sponsored by [[Julia Lathrop]], America's first director of the [[United States Children's Bureau|U.S. Children's Bureau]]. Although the law remained in effect only eight years, it set the trend for [[New Deal]] social programs during the 1930s. Many women who had been given the right to vote in 1920, were given career opportunities as welfare and social workers.<ref>[[#Sreenivasan|Sreenivasan]], p. 567.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=A historic look at health care legislation|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/03/23/a_historic_look_at_health_care_legislation/|agency=Associated Press|date=March 23, 2010| accessdate=2011-02-26|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

====Religious toleration====
Harding was tolerant towards religious faiths. He appointed prominent Rabbi Joseph S. Kornfeld and [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=940DE3DE1E30EE3ABC4053DFB4668389639EDE Father Joseph M. Denning], to foreign diplomatic positions. He also appointed [[Albert Lasker]], a Jewish businessman and Harding's 1920 Presidential campaign manager, head of the Shipping Department. In an unpublished letter, Harding advocated the establishment and funding of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.<ref>Anthony (July–August), ''The Most Scandalous President''</ref>

===Life at the White House===
[[File:President Harding and Laddie Boy.jpg|thumb|President Harding with his dog [[Laddie Boy (dog)|Laddie Boy]]. Photo: 1922]]

Katherine Marcia Forbes, wife of Harding's Veterans Bureau appointment [[Charles R. Forbes]], had unprecedented access to the White House. [[Florence Harding|Mrs. Harding]] and Katherine had become close friends since meeting in Hawaii, when Senator Harding and his wife were on vacation. In 1921, Katherine Forbes wrote a series of articles for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' describing the daily life of President Harding and the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]. President Harding and Mrs. Harding wanted to be known as, "...just home folks." At dinners, Harding's dog [[Laddie Boy (dog)|Laddie Boy]], was allowed to beg guests for food and play with children. Red velvet upholstery covered much of the furniture. Harding's informal dress included a plain tuxedo, pleated shirt, and pearl studs. Mrs. Harding herself was able to talk with many guests at the same time. Inside the White House, the Hardings had a great [[grandfather clock]], a gold fish bowl, a French vase with [[pussy willow]]s, neutral color rugs, and a [[grand piano]]. Harding sometimes gave children private tours of the White House that included the conservatories and [[kennel]]s.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 451.</ref>

Harding's lifestyle at the White House was fairly unconventional compared to his predecessor President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Upstairs at the White House, in the [[Yellow Oval Room]], Harding allowed bootleg whiskey to be freely served to his guests during after-dinner parties at a time when the President was supposed to enforce Prohibition. One witness, [[Alice Longworth]], daughter of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], stated that trays, "...with bottles containing every imaginable brand of whiskey stood about."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Behr|first1=Edward|title=Prohibition: Thirteen Years That Changed America|edition=reprint, illustrated|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-1611450095}}</ref> Some of this alcohol had been directly confiscated from the Prohibition department by [[Jess Smith]], assistant to U.S. Attorney General [[Harry Daugherty]]. Mrs. Harding, also known as the "Duchess", mixed drinks for the guests.<ref name="A President Of the Peephole">Anthony, Carl [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/harding.htm "A President Of the Peephole"], ''The Washington Post'', June 7, 1998; retrieved December 24, 2010.</ref> Harding played poker twice a week, smoked and chewed tobacco. Harding allegedly won a $4,000 pearl necktie pin at one White House poker game.<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 212–216</ref> Although criticized by Prohibitionist advocate [[Wayne B. Wheeler]] over Washington, D.C. rumors of these "wild parties", Harding claimed his personal drinking inside the White House was his own business.<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 270–71</ref>

===Administrative scandals===
Upon winning the election, Harding appointed many of his longtime allies and campaign contributors to prominent political positions in control of vast amounts of government money and resources. Known as the "Ohio Gang" (a term used by [[Charles L. Mee|Charles Mee, Jr.]], in his book of the same name), some of the appointees used their new powers to exploit their positions for personal gain. Although Harding was responsible for making these appointments, it is unclear how much, if anything, Harding himself knew about his friends' illicit activities. No evidence to date suggests that Harding personally profited from such crimes, but he was apparently unable to prevent them. "I have no trouble with my enemies", Harding told journalist [[William Allen White]] late in his presidency, "but my damn friends, they're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights!"<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 560.</ref> The only scandal which was openly discovered during Harding's lifetime was in the Veteran's Bureau.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 523.</ref> Yet the gossip became rampant after the suicides of Charles Cramer (Veterans Bureau) and Jess Smith (Justice Dept.) Harding responded aggressively to all of this with a mixture of grief, anger and perplexity.

Before any of the scandalous activity became widely known, Harding's popularity began to ebb, but he responded with determination to run for re-election, despite strong support emerging for the very popular Henry Ford for the Democrats.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 564.</ref> While on his trip to [[Alaska]] in 1923, Harding asked reporters and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, how he should respond to associates who may have betrayed him.<ref>[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 102–103</ref> He also said at this time, according to Joe Mitchell Chapple, "Someday the people will understand all that some of my erstwhile friends have done for me."<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 569.</ref> However much he did know at the time of his departure for Alaska, Russell concludes it did not include Fall and Daugherty.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 570.</ref> Harding reformed the corrupt Veteran's Bureau in March, 1923.<ref name="The Helena Daily Independent 1923 p. 4">''The Helena Daily Independent'' (March 19, 1923), "Veterans' Bureau Probe", p. 4</ref>

====Teapot Dome====
{{Further|Teapot Dome scandal}}
[[File:Albert B. Fall c. 1923.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Albert B. Fall]], Harding's first Secretary of the Interior and the first former Cabinet member sent to prison]]
The most notorious scandal was [[Teapot Dome]], most of which came to light after Harding's death. This affair concerned an oil reserve in Wyoming that was covered by a teapot-shaped rock formation. For years, the country had taken measures to ensure the availability of petroleum reserves, particularly for the Navy's use.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 489.</ref> On February 23, 1923, Harding issued Executive Order # 3797, which created the [[National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska|Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4]] in [[Alaska]]. By the 1920s, it was clear that petroleum was important to the national economy and security. The reserve system was to keep the oil under government jurisdiction rather than subject to private claims.<ref>{{cite web|title=529 F.2d 1101|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/529/529.F2d.1101.74--2218.html|date=Jan 23, 1976|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> Management of these reserves was the subject of multi-dimensional arguments—beginning with a turf battle between the Secretary of the Navy and the Interior Dept.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 490.</ref> The strategic reserves issue was also a debate topic between conservationists and the petroleum industry, as well as those who favored public ownership versus private control.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 491.</ref> Harding's [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Albert B. Fall]], brought to that office significant political and legal experience, in addition to heavy personal debt, incurred in his obsession to expand his personal estate, Three Rivers, in New Mexico. He also was an avid supporter of the private ownership and management of reserves.<ref name="Russell, p. 492">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 492.</ref>

Fall contracted [[Edward Doheny]] of Pan American Corp. to build storage tanks in exchange for drilling rights. It later came to light that Doheny had made significant personal loans to Fall.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 493.</ref> The Secretary also negotiated leases for the Teapot Dome reserves to Harry Sinclair of the Consolidated Oil Corp. in return for guaranteed oil reserves to the credit of the government. Again, it later emerged that Sinclair had personally made concurrent cash payments of over $400,000 to Fall.<ref name="Russell, p. 492"/> These activities took place under the unsuspecting watch of progressive and conservationist attorney, [[Harry Slattery]], acting for [[Gifford Pinchot]] and [[Robert La Follete]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 499.</ref> Fall was ultimately convicted in 1931 of accepting bribes and illegal no-interest personal loans in exchange for the leasing of public oil fields to business associates.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 497.</ref> In 1931, Fall was the first cabinet member in history imprisoned for crimes committed while in office.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 498.</ref> Paradoxically, while Fall was convicted for taking the bribe, Doheny was acquitted of paying it.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 638.</ref>

====Justice Department====
[[File:Harry Daugherty, bw photo portrait 1920.jpg|thumb |160px|right |[[Harry M. Daugherty]]<br />[[U.S. Attorney General]]<br />Photo taken 1920.]]

Harding's appointment of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. As Harding's campaign manager, Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers with politicians were not considered the best qualifications.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 444.</ref> Historian M.R. Werner referred to the Justice Department under Harding and Daugherty as "the den of a ward politician and the White House a night club". On September 16, 1922, Minnesota Congressman [[Oscar E. Keller]] brought impeachment charges against Daugherty. On December 4, formal investigation hearings, headed by congressman [[Andrew J. Volstead]], began against Daugherty. The impeachment process, however, stopped, since Keller's charges that Daugherty protected interests in trust and war fraud cases could not be substantially proven.<ref>[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 230–37.</ref>

One alleged scandal involving Daugherty concerned the [[Wright-Martin|Wright-Martin Aircraft Corp.]], which supposedly overcharged the Federal government by $2.3 million on war contracts.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 509.</ref> Capt. Hazel Scaife tried to bring the company to trial, but was blocked by the Department of Justice. At this time, Daugherty was said to have owned stock in the company and was even adding to these holdings, though he was never charged in the matter.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 510.</ref>

Daugherty remained in his position during the early days of the Calvin Coolidge administration, then resigned on March 28, 1924, amidst allegations that he accepted bribes from bootleggers. Daugherty was later tried and acquitted twice for corruption. Both juries [[Hung jury|hung]]—in one case, after 65 hours of deliberation. Daugherty's famous defense attorney, Max D. Steuer, blamed all corruption allegations against Daugherty on [[Jess Smith]], an aide at the Justice Department who had committed suicide.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 515.</ref><ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 510, 630.</ref>

Harding's Attorney General hired William J. Burns to run the Justice Dept.'s Bureau of Investigation,<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 516.</ref> Burns was said to be unabashed in his willingness to conduct unauthorized searches and seizures of political enemies of the Justice Dept. A number of inquisitive congressmen or senators found themselves the object of wire taps, rifled files, and copied correspondence.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 517.</ref> Burns' primary operative was [[Gaston Means|Gaston B. Means]], a reputed con man, who was known to have fixed prosecutions, sold favors, and manipulated files in the Justice Dept.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 518.</ref> Means, who acted independently, took direct instructions and payments from Jess Smith, without Burn's knowledge, to spy on Congressmen. Means hired a woman, Laura Jacobson, to spy on Senator [[Thaddeus Caraway]], a critic of the Harding administration. Means also was involved with "roping" bootleggers.<ref>[[#Werner|Werner]] pp. 230–237"</ref>

[[Narcotic]] trafficking was rampant at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Penitentiary]] while Daugherty was Attorney General. The appointed warden, J.E. Dyche, made internal prison reforms by firing two guards while two other officers were indicted by the Justice Department. Daugherty, however, was slow to follow up on these indictments. As Dyche began to investigate the drug supply ring outside the prison, Daugherty fired him and replaced him with a close friend, A. E. Sartain. Daugherty stopped the investigation into the drug ring until the two indicted officers were brought to trial. The Superintendent of Prisons, Heber Votaw, allegedly interfered and suppressed Dyche's attempted investigation into the narcotic ring outside the prison. Votaw, was Harding's brother-in-law, and had been appointed by the President in April 1921. Harding sent [[Charles R. Forbes]], Director of the Veterans Bureau, to privately investigate the matter. This upset Daugherty, who said the Atlanta prison situation was none of Forbes' business.<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 262–264;{{Cite news| title=Prison Scandals|newspaper=Evening Post|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19250407.2.14&l=mi&e=-------10--1----0-- |page=3|date=April 7, 1925|accessdate= December 1, 2011}}</ref>

Daugherty, according to a 1924 Senate investigation into the Justice Department, had authorized a system of graft between aides [[Jess Smith]] and Howard Mannington. Both Mannington and Smith allegedly took bribes to secure appointments, prison pardons, and freedom from prosecution. A majority of these purchasable pardons were directed towards [[Rum-running|bootleggers]]. [[Cincinnati]] bootlegger, George L. Remus, allegedly paid Jess Smith $250,000 to not prosecute him. Remus, however, ''was'' prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to Atlanta prison. Smith tried to extract more bribe money from Remus to pay for a pardon. The prevalent question at the Justice Department was "How is he fixed?"<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 236–237</ref>

====Jess W. Smith====
[[File:Jesse W. Smith.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Jess W. Smith]]]]
Daugherty's personal aide, Jess W. Smith, was widely viewed as the Attorney General's (and therefore the President's) spokesman and henchman. Smith was considered Daugherty's proxy, and a central figure, in government file manipulation, paroles and pardons, influence peddling—and even served as [[bagman|bag man]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 513-14.</ref>

During [[Prohibition]], [[pharmacies]] received alcohol permits to sell alcohol for medical purposes. According to Congressional testimony, Daugherty allegedly arranged for Jess Smith and Howard Mannington to sell these permits to drug company agents who really represented bootleggers. The bootleggers, having obtained a permit could buy cases of whiskey. Smith and Mannington split the permit sales profits. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 cases of whiskey were sold to bootleggers at a net worth of $750,000 to $900,000. Smith supplied bootleg whiskey to the White House and the Ohio Gang house on K Street, concealing the whiskey in a briefcase for poker games.<ref name="Werner, pp. 266–272"/><ref name="A President Of the Peephole"/>

Eventually, rumors of Smith's abuses—free use of government cars, going to all night parties, manipulation of Justice Department files—reached Harding. Harding withdrew Smith's White House clearance and Daugherty told him to leave Washington. On May 30, 1923, Smith's dead body was found at Daugherty's apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. William J. Burns immediately took Smith's body away and there was no [[autopsy]]. Historian Francis Russell, concluding this was a suicide, indicates that a Daugherty aide entered Smith's room moments after a noise awoke him, and found Smith on the floor with his head in a trash can and a revolver in his hand. Russell also states that Smith had purchased the gun (though he was said to have detested guns), that a bullet had entered Smith's temple, exited the forehead, and lodged in a doorjamb. Smith allegedly purchased the gun from a hardware store shortly before his death, after Daugherty verbally abused him for waking him up from a nap.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 568-69.</ref><ref>[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 238–63, 306–07</ref>

====Veterans' bureau====
[[File:Cforbes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles R. Forbes]], director of the Veterans Bureau and convicted of defrauding the government]]
[[Charles R. Forbes]], the energetic Director of the Veterans Bureau, disregarded the dire needs of wounded [[World War I]] veterans to procure his own wealth.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], pp. 286, 292.</ref> To limit corruption in the Veterans' Bureau, Harding insisted that all government contracts be by public notice, but Forbes provided inside information to his co-conspirators to ensure their bids succeeded.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 526.</ref> After his appointment, Forbes was quick to have Harding issue executive orders that gave him control over veterans' hospital construction and supplies.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 523.</ref> Forbes defrauded the government of an estimated $225&nbsp;million through hospital construction, after increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], pp. 525.</ref> Forbes' main task at the Veterans bureau, having an unprecedented $500 million yearly budget, was to ensure that new hospitals were built around the country to help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 287.</ref>

In the Spring of 1922, Forbes went on tours, known as ''joy-rides'', of new hospital construction sites around the country and the Pacific Coast. On these tours, Forbes allegedly received traveling perks and alcohol kickbacks, took a $5,000 bribe in Chicago, and made a secret code to ensure $17 million in government construction hospital contracts with corrupt contractors. On the tours, Forbes allegedly went to parties, drank bootleg liquor, and played craps.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 555.</ref>

Intent on making more money, on his return to the U.S. Capitol Forbes immediately began selling valuable hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], pp. 289, 292.</ref> The government had stockpiled huge amounts of hospital supplies during the first World War, which Forbes unloaded for a fraction of their cost to the [[Boston]] firm of Thompson and Kelly. In exchange for the deal, [[J.W. Thompson]] of the firm added $150,000 to the contract for Forbes, who also received a percentage of the profits realized.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 524</ref><ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 292.</ref> The check on Forbes' authority at Perryville was Gen. [[Charles E. Sawyer]], chairman of the Federal Hospitalization Board, who represented controlling interests in the valuable hospital supplies.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], pp. 232, 292, 294.</ref>
[[File:Dr. Sawyer 1920.jpg|thumb |right|240px|Dr. Charles Sawyer and Forbes were rivals at the Veterans Bureau.]]
Dr. Sawyer and Forbes were at odds with each other over authority at the Veterans Bureau.<ref>Werner (1935), ''Privileged Characters'', p. 194</ref> Sawyer, a [[homeopathic]] doctor who was Harding's personal physician, told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 294.</ref> After issuing two orders for the sales to stop, Harding finally summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded Forbes' [[resignation]], since Forbes had been insubordinate in not stopping the shipments.<ref>''Los Angeles Times'' (November 8, 1923), ''Says Forbes Forced Out'', page I1.</ref> Harding, however, was not yet ready to announce Forbes' resignation and let him flee to Europe on the "flimsy pretext" that he would help disabled U.S. Veterans in Europe.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 559.</ref><ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 296.</ref> While in Europe, Forbes submitted his resignation to Harding on February 15, 1923.

Harding placed a reformer, [[Brigadier General]] [[Frank T. Hines]], in charge of the Veterans Bureau. Hines immediately cleared up the mess left by Forbes. When Forbes returned to the U.S., he visited Harding at the White House in the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]]. During the meeting, Harding angrily grabbed Forbes by the throat, shook him vigorously, and exclaimed "You double-crossing bastard!"<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 558.</ref> A guest who had an appointment with the President interrupted this physical encounter and Forbes was allowed to leave. Harding was bitter over Forbes' "[[betrayal]]" and the two never saw each other again.<ref>[[#Adams|Adams]], p. 297.</ref> In 1926, Forbes was brought to trial and convicted of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. He received a two-year [[prison sentence]] and was released in November 1927.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 562.</ref>

Charles F. Cramer, Forbes' legal council to the Veterans Bureau, rocked the nation's capital when he committed suicide in 1923.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 563; The ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' (March 15, 1923), ''Charles F. Cramer Ex-Veterans' Bureau Counsel A Suicide, p. I4</ref> Cramer was found dead by a maid in his bathroom on the morning of March 14 with a bullet wound to the head. Previously, in the fall of 1922 Cramer had been "bitterly assailed" by the [[American Legion]] at [[Indianapolis]] over alleged corruption at the Veterans Bureau. Cramer, at the time of his death, was being investigated by a Senate committee and had been criticized and personally attacked. Cramer, himself, had denied charges of corruption and said he had given his "whole-hearted and patriotic service" to the Bureau. Cramer had paid $40,000 in Veteran funds to a private landholder to lease land to build a Veterans Hospital in [[Camp Kearny]], California. The estimated value of the 325-[[acre]] land tract was only $8,000. Maj. Gen. [[John F. O'Ryan]] conducted the investigation into the Veterans' Bureau. In addition to replacing Forbes with Hines, Harding dismissed or transferred a number of subordinates at the Veteran's Bureau.<ref>The ''Hartford Courant'' (March 15, 1923), ''Charles F. Cramer Ex-Veterans' Bureau Counsel A Suicide'', p. I4; The ''Helena Daily Independent'' (March 19, 1923), ''Veterans' Bureau Probe'', p. 4</ref>

====Shipping board, office of alien property and prohibition bureau====
[[Image:Warren G. Harding at Postal Museum in Washington, D.C. IMG 4366.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Harding as he appears at the [[National Postal Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
On June 13, 1921, Harding appointed Albert D. Lasker chairman of the [[United States Shipping Board]]. Lasker, a cash donor and Harding's general campaign manager, had no previous experience with shipping companies. The [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] had allowed the Shipping Board to sell ships made by the U.S. Government to private American companies. A congressional investigation revealed that while Lasker was in charge, many valuable steel cargo ships, worth between $200 and $250 a ton, were sold for as low as $30 a ton to private American shipping companies without an appraisal board. J. Harry Philbin, a manager in the sales division, testified at the congressional hearing that under Lasker's authority U.S. ships were sold, "...as is, where is, take your pick, no matter which vessel you took." Lasker resigned from the Shipping Board on July 1, 1923.<ref>[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 328–29.</ref>

[[Thomas W. Miller]], head of the [[Alien Property Custodian|Office of Alien Property]], was convicted of accepting bribes. Miller's citizenship rights were taken away and he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine. After Miller served 13 months of his sentence, he was released on parole. President Herbert Hoover restored Miller's citizenship on February 2, 1933.<ref>[[#Werner|Werner]], pp. 316-17</ref>

[[Roy Asa Haynes]], Harding's Prohibition Commissioner, ran the patronage-riddled Prohibition bureau, which was allegedly corrupt from top to bottom.<ref name="Russell, pp. 520">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 520.</ref> The bureau's "B permits" for liquor sales became tantamount to negotiable securities, as a result of being so widely bought and sold among known violators of the law.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 521.</ref> The bureau's agents allegedly made a year's salary from one month's illicit sales of permits.<ref name="Russell, pp. 520"/>

===Western travels, illness and death===
In June 1923, Harding set out on a westward cross-country ''Voyage of Understanding'', in which he planned to renew his connection with the people, away from the capital, and explain his policies. The schedule included 18 speeches and innumerable informal talks. Accompanying him were Secretaries Work, Wallace, and Hoover, House Speaker Gillett, and Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 573.</ref> During this trip, he became the first president to visit [[Alaska]].<ref>Reeve, W. Paul. [http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/from_war_to_war/presidenthardings1923visittoutah.html Harding's 1923 Visit to Utah], ''History Blazer'', July 1995; retrieved December 3, 2010.</ref>

Harding's physical health had declined since the fall of 1922. One doctor, Emmanuel Libman, who met Harding at a dinner, privately suggested that the President was suffering from coronary disease. By early 1923, Harding had trouble sleeping, looked tired, and could barely get through nine holes of golf.

Though Harding wanted to run for a second term, he may have been aware of his own health decline. He gave up drinking, sold his "life-work," the Marion ''Star'', in part to regain $170,000 previous investment losses, and had the U.S. Attorney General Harry Daugherty make a new will. Harding, along with his personal physician Dr. [[Charles E. Sawyer]], believed getting away from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] would help relieve the stress of being President. By July 1923, criticism of the Harding Administration was increasing. Prior to his leaving Washington, the President reported chest pains that radiated down his left arm.<ref>Adams (1934), ''Incredible Era", pp. 333–339; {{Cite book|last=Wilber|first= Ray Lyman|title=The Memoirs of Ray Lyman Wilbur 1875–1949|publisher=Stanford University Press| location=Stanford, California|year=1960|pages=378–384}}</ref>

====St. Louis, Kansas, Denver====
During Harding's western travels, historian [[Samuel Hopkins Adams|Samuel H. Adams]] claims that Harding's political views began to expand, and became more independent from established Republican Party agenda. In St. Louis, Harding promoted U.S. participation in the World Court having earnestly desired world peace. In Kansas, Harding gave a speech on agriculture and, much to his doctor's displeasure, rode on a farming [[Combine harvester|combine]] in searing summer heat.

In Denver, Harding extolled the virtues of the 18th Amendment, saying it should never be repealed, urging that the prohibition laws be obeyed.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 577; Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 366–371</ref> Harding, himself, did not pack any whiskey for traveling on the Presidential train. Breaking away from Republican isolationism, Harding advocated more spending on national defense in case of another war. Harding also made a speech fully endorsing labor's right to organize, and even spoke against those who sought to destroy labor movements around the country. In Tacoma, Washington, the President read a letter that promoted his efforts for a 12-hour work day. Sensing his own conversion, Harding even told his friends that he felt a spiritual change was influencing his stance on issues.<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 366–371</ref>

====Alaska trip====
[[image:President Harding in Alaska on Presidential Train.jpg|300px |thumb |right |President Harding on board Presidential train in Alaska.<br/>Sec. Hoover, Sec. Wallace, Sec. Work, and Mrs. Harding included in Presidential Party. ''1923'']]
President Harding, as his physically demanding schedule continued, boarded a naval transport ship, the {{USS|Henderson|AP-1|6}}, and voyaged to Alaska. During four days at sea, Harding was unable to rest and regain strength.<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 371, 372</ref> Rumors of [[political corruption|corruption]] in his administration were beginning to circulate in Washington. While in Alaska, Harding was profoundly shocked by a long message he received detailing illegal activities previously unknown to him.<ref name="Russell">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 589.</ref>

Harding came to the most northern U.S. territory to "open up Alaska lands" for oil, mining, timber development, and industry.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Saul|first=John B. |title='The Quiet World': Douglas Brinkley's history of the struggle to preserve Alaska's wilderness|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2014047973_br30alaska.html|date=January 29, 2011|accessdate=July 2, 2011|work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>  He also wanted to encourage settlers to move to the sparsely populated territory. Harding hoped that, with completion of the [[Alaska Railroad]], World War I veterans from Alaska would return to their home territory, and impoverished workers in the lower states could go to Alaska for employment. Harding brought along the secretaries of the Interior, Commerce, and Agriculture to cut through bureaucracy in their respective departmental jurisdictions.<ref name="Field 6">{{Cite news|last= Field|first=Carter|title=Alaska Again, A Land of Promise|location=Champaign-Urbana, Illinois| newspaper=Urbana Daily Courier|page=6|date=May 9, 1935}}</ref>

Harding arrived in Alaska on the ''Henderson'' on July 7, 1923. Harding and his presidential party first visited [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] (July 8), and [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]] (July 9). They continued on to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] (July 10), [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], and Glacier Bay (July 11).<ref name="Warren G. Harding">{{cite web|title= Warren G.

They then proceeded to travel by Presidential railway car and automobile. Harding visited [[Snow River, Alaska|Snow River]] on the Kenai Peninsula, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] (July 13), [[Chickaloon, Alaska|Chickaloon]], [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] and [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]] (July 14). The U.S. government had bought up the financially unstable [[Tanana Valley Railroad]]. The President continued his Alaska journey through Montana Station, Curry (July 14) Cantwell, McKinley Park and [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (July 15).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska Railroad|url=http://knowyourgovernment.wordpress.com/2009/12/22/alaska-railroad/|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2011}};{{cite web|title=Warren G.

Harding"/> The trip continued to Fairbanks (July 15). He went to Seward (July 18), [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] (July 19), [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] (July 20), and [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] (July 22).

The information gathered by Harding's Alaska tour found that improving agriculture in south central Alaska would require irrigation because of the low rainfall totals. By 1923, the Alaskan salmon population was being depleted from overfishing. Harvesting and transporting coal by ship from Alaska through the territory's panhandle would be very expensive.<ref name="Field 6"/>

On July 26, 1923, Harding toured [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] as the first sitting American President ever to visit Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/archives_harding.htm |title=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver |section=Warren G. Harding & Stanley Park |accessdate=December 23, 2013 |publisher=Chuck Davis }}</ref>

Harding became exhausted while playing golf and complained of nausea and upper abdominal pain. His doctor, Charles E. Sawyer, believed Harding's illness was a severe case of [[food poisoning]]. Nevertheless, [[Joel Thompson Boone|Dr. Joel T. Boone]] also examined the President and noticed an enlargement of his heart.<ref name="Russell"/>  He was given [[digitalis]].  Nevertheless Harding met with British Columbia Premier [[John Oliver (politician)|John Oliver]] and Mayor of Vancouver [[Charles Tisdall]] and spoke in front of 50,000 people with his voice projected by microphones.

Coming into [[Seattle, Washington]] Harding kept up his busy schedule, giving a speech to 25,000 people at the [[University of Washington]] stadium in Seattle. Harding spoke on the magnificence of Alaska's wilderness, [[conservationism]], and "measureless oil resources in the most northerly sections." Sec. of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] wrote the Seattle speech and Harding claimed he would protect the territory from looters and profit seekers; a rebuff to former Sec. of Interior [[Albert Fall]].<ref>Russell (1968), ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', pp. 588–589</ref> Harding had rushed through his speech not waiting for applause by the audience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lange|first=Greg|title=U.S. President Warren G.

Harding's scheduled speech in Portland was canceled.

====Death in San Francisco, state funeral and memorial====
[[Image:HardingFuneral.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession for President Harding passes by the front of the [[White House]]]]
The President's train continued south to San Francisco. Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] sent a telegram from [[Dunsmuir, California]], to his friend Dr. [[Ray L. Wilbur]], asking Wilbur to meet and to personally evaluate the President. Arriving at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] in San Francisco, Harding developed a [[respiratory]] illness believed to be [[pneumonia]].<ref name="Russell, p. 591">[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 591.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last= Wilbur|first=Ray Lyman|title=The Memoirs of Ray Lyman Wilbur 1875–1949|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|year=1960|pages=378–384}};{{cite web|title=Warren Harding: His Final Illness|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/z_x29wilbur_g.htm|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Harding, severely exhausted, ordered that his planned speech be issued through the national press in order to communicate with the public.

[[image:Harding Memorial Marion Ohio.jpg|thumb|The [[Harding Memorial]] in [[Marion, Ohio]].<br> Dedicated in 1931.]]

The funeral train made a four-day journey eastward across the country—the first such procession since Lincoln's funeral train. Millions lined the tracks in cities and towns across the country to pay their respects.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 598.</ref> Harding's casket was placed in the East Room of the [[White House]] pending a [[state funeral]], which was held on August 8, 1923, at the [[United States Capitol]].

After her own death on November 21, 1924, Mrs. Harding was interred next to her husband. Their remains were re-interred December 20, 1927, at the newly completed [[Harding Memorial]] in [[Marion, Ohio]] in 1931. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

===Speculation on cause of death===
Harding's sudden death led to theories that he had been poisoned<ref name="death"/> or committed suicide. Suicide appears unlikely, since Harding was planning for reelection in 1924. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in part, by a book called ''The Strange Death of President Harding'', in which the author, a convicted criminal, [[Gaston Means]], suggested Mrs. Harding had poisoned her husband, an assertion which has since been completely discredited as false. {{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} 

Mrs. Harding's refusal to allow an autopsy added to such speculation. According to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms prior to his death all pointed to [[congestive heart failure]]. Harding's biographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that "Warren G. Harding died a natural death which, in any case, could not have been long postponed".<ref>Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', pp. 377–84</ref>

===Disposition of Presidential papers===
Immediately after Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to [[Washington, D.C.]], and stayed in the White House briefly with the Coolidges.  In 1963 Francis Russell, writing in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', stated that former First Lady Harding gathered and burned as much of President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial, as she could get. Russell also wrote that Mrs. Harding hired secretaries upon returning to [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], to help her collect Harding's personal correspondence to others and that Mrs. Harding then in turn destroyed these letters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Francis|journal=American Heritage|title=The Four Mysteries Of Warren Harding|date=April 1963|volume=14|issue=3|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/four-mysteries-warren-harding?page=show|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

However, [[John Dean]], in ''Warren G. Harding:The American Presidents Series'', states that Mrs. Harding's efforts were in vain and that George Christian, President Harding's private secretary, disobeyed Florence Harding's instructions, only sending a few boxes of materials to her in Marion after she left the White House. The papers were instead stored in the White House's basement and not found until 1929. Christian also kept all of the papers from Harding's time in the Senate, along with records of Harding's Presidential campaign, and stored them in the basement of his own home in Marion.

By 1935, according to Dean, the Presidential papers were all under the purview of the Harding Memorial Association which in late 1963 transferred the papers to the Ohio Historical Society and that the substantial collection was opened to the public in April 1964.  The papers were subsequently microfilmed in the 1970s and can be accessed at various libraries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dean|first=John W.|title=Warren G.

Historian [[Francis Russell (author)|Francis Russell]] wrote that, beginning in the spring of 1905, Harding had a 15-year relationship with [[Carrie Fulton Phillips]], wife of businessman and friend James Eaton Phillips of [[Marion, Ohio]].<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 167</ref> More than 100 intimate letters between Harding and Mrs. Philips were discovered in the 1960s, but publication of the letters was enjoined by court order in Ohio until 2024.<ref name="Graff, p. 399">[[#Graff|Graff]], p. 399.</ref> Russell, however, viewed the letters upon their discovery and described them as very touching and naive in some respects, erotic in others.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. ix.</ref> Russell concluded from the letters that Phillips was the love of Harding's life — "the enticements of his mind and body combined in one person".<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 167.</ref>

Before his death, Harding had established a [[margin account]] with stockbroker Sam Ungerleider. Before the broker could get authority from Harding's successors to liquidate the stocks purchased on loan, the account had a loss of more than $170,000. The broker was given the authority to sell, but the family refused to settle the loss and the broker declined to force collection.<ref>[[#Russell|Russell]], p. 608.</ref>

The most sensational allegations include one that Harding and Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty participated in [[bacchanalian]] orgies at the [[Ohio Gang]]'s [[Little Green House on K Street]] in Washington, D.C.; witnesses to this were considered unreliable and one was a convicted perjurer.<ref>Graff, p. 399.</ref> Also, in his 1987 book ''The Fiery Cross'', historian Wyn Craig Wade suggested that Harding [[Ku Klux Klan members in United States politics#Warren G. Harding|had ties with the Ku Klux Klan]], perhaps having been inducted into the organization in a private White House ceremony. Evidence included the taped testimony of one of the members of the alleged induction team; however, evidence beyond that is scanty. Other historians generally dismiss these stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhardingkkk.html|title=Was Warren Harding inducted into the KKK while president?|first=John|last=Corrado|work=[[The Straight Dope]]|date=November 8, 2005|publisher=Creative Loafing Media, Inc.|location=Chicago, IL|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref> Several historians, including Robert H. Ferrell and Paul Johnson, reject claims of orgies and mistresses. Johnson writes in ''Modern Times'': "When in 1964 the Harding Papers (which had not been burnt) were opened to scholars, no truth at all was found in any of the myths, though it emerged that Harding, a pathetically shy man with women, had a sad and touching friendship with the wife of a Marion store-owner before his presidency. The Babylonian image was a fantasy, and in all essentials Harding had been an honest and exceptionally shrewd president."<ref>Paul Johnson, ''Modern Times''</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

==Historical ranking as president==
Harding has been traditionally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|ranked as one of the worst presidents]]. In a 1948 poll conducted by [[Harvard University]] historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], the first notable survey of scholars' opinions of the presidents, Harding ranked last among the 29 presidents considered. In a 1962 poll conducted by Schlesinger, he was ranked last again, 31 out of 31. His son, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], conducted another poll in 1996; once again, Harding was last, ranked 39 out of 39.  In 2010, a [[Siena College Research Institute]] survey of 238 presidential scholars ranked Harding 41st among the 43 men who had been president, between [[Franklin Pierce]] (40th) and [[James Buchanan]] (42nd); [[Andrew Johnson]] was adjudged the worst.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The 10 Worst Presidents: Warren G. Harding|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/07/02/survey-ranks-obama-15th-best-president-bush-among-worst|newspaper=U.S. News & World Report|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=July 2, 2010|last=Kim|first=Mallie Jane}}</ref> Harding was also considered the third worst president in a 2002 Siena poll. Siena polls of 1982, 1990 and 1992 ranked him last.

However, Harding's biographer [[John W. Dean]] in 2004 believed that Harding was underrated.<ref name=Jeansonne-Luhrssen_p_248>Jeansonne-Luhrssen (2006) ''A Time of Paradox: America Since 1890'', p. 248</ref> Authors [[Marcus Raskin]] and Robert Spero, in 2007, also believed that Harding was underrated, and admired Harding's quest for world peace after [[World War I]] and his successful naval disarmament among strongly armed nations, including [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Japan]].<ref name=Raskin-Spero_p242>Raskin-Spero (2007), ''The Four Freedoms Under Siege'', p. 242</ref>  In his 2010 book ''The Leaders We Deserved (and a Few We Didn't): Rethinking the Presidential Rating Game'', presidential historian [[Alvin S. Felzenberg]], ranking presidents on several criteria, ranked Harding 26th out of 40 presidents considered.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Felzenberg|first=Alvin S.|authorlink=Alvin S.

As a career politician, Harding exhibited an ability to grow, and had a desire to get along with political enemies rather than alienate them. As a prior [[journalist]], Harding was the first President to realize the importance of an ever growing powerful media, and even ordered his cabinet to organize their own respective press staff. He knew that radio would eventually dominate American commerce and promoted two Radio Conferences to give government power to regulate the industry. Harding also sensed the importance of oil in terms of national security and prosperity, signing an executive order that gave the U.S. a giant oil reserve in Alaska. He also signed America's first child welfare program designed to protect children's health and ensure that they would grow up without neglect from their parents. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

Harding's generosity and loyalty to friends was a liability as President. Multiple scandals evolved during his administration that damaged his reputation throughout the nation. His successes as President were overshadowed by the "Ohio Gang" criminal exploits, the detrimental image of his social drinking, and his alleged extramarital affairs. His sudden death in 1923 only intensified unanswered questions concerning his knowledge of, and potential involvement in, the scandals—and if he would have reformed his administration. His reputation was so controversial that not until 1931 was Harding's marble memorial colonnade in Marion dedicated by Herbert Hoover. According to Hoover, Harding's legacy was one of tragic betrayal.<ref>[[#Graff|Graff]], pp. 398–400.</ref>

Harding's legacy began to improve during the 1970s, however. The truth behind the many presidential scandals and his personal controversies may never be known. To protect her husband's damaged legacy, [[Florence Harding|Mrs. Harding]] only left 1/7 of Harding's personal papers for posterity. She destroyed the rest.<ref>Brogan (1985), ''The Penguin History of the United States of America'', p. 515</ref> The remaining papers, except for Harding's speeches, are currently unpublished. Harding has been one of the most historically challenging American Presidents in terms of finding private letters and paper documents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Papers&nbsp;— Warren G. Harding (1865–1923)|url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/onlinereference/presidentialpapers/harding| accessdate=2010-12-29}}; Adams (1939, 1964), ''Incredible Era'', Preface, p. 425</ref> Historian [[Hazel Rowley]] writes that because the Harding administration and the Republicans were seen associated with prosperity, prominent Democrats were reluctant to run for president in 1924.<ref>[[Hazel Rowley|Rowley, Hazel]]; ''Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage'' (2010), p. 124.</ref>

Because of his untimely demise, Warren G. Harding is among the relatively few American Presidents who have been honored on a U.S. postage stamp more than the usual two times. Harding has appeared on US postage for a total of five issues, more than that of most Presidents.<ref name="Scotts Quantity Issued"/><ref name="arago1"/>  Harding's election provided a short burst of popularity for the name Warren.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/did-president-warren-g-harding-spark-a-baby-naming-trend/ |title=Did President Warren G.
