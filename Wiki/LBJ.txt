'''Lyndon Baines Johnson''' ({{IPAc-en|'|l|?|n|d|?|n|_|'|b|e?|n|z|_|'|d?|?|n|s|?|n}}) (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to as '''LBJ''', was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|36th]] [[President of the United States]] (1963–1969), a position he assumed after his service as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|37th]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1961–1963). Johnson, a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] from [[Texas]], served as a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from 1937 to 1949 and as a [[United States Senator]] from 1949 to 1961, including six years as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], two as Senate Minority Leader and two as [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Whip]]. He campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960, but ran as Vice President with [[John F. Kennedy]] heading the ticket for the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]]. After their election, Johnson [[United States presidential line of succession|succeeded]] Kennedy following the latter's [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] on November 22, 1963; he completed Kennedy's term and was elected President in his own right in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]], winning by a large margin over [[Barry Goldwater]]. He is one of four people<ref>The other three people who served in all four elected offices were [[John Tyler]], [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].</ref> who served in both offices of the executive branch as well as both houses of Congress.<ref name="Capitol"/>

Johnson was strongly supported by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and as President he designed the "[[Great Society]]" legislation upholding [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights]], [[public broadcasting]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], environmental protection, aid to education, the arts, urban and rural development, and his "[[War on Poverty]]". Assisted in part by a growing economy, the War on Poverty helped millions of Americans rise above the poverty line during Johnson's presidency.<ref name="Califano">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A. |last=Califano Jr. |work=[[Washington Monthly]]|date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> Civil rights bills signed by Johnson banned racial discrimination in public facilities, interstate commerce, the workplace, and housing; and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|voting rights act]] guaranteed full voting rights for citizens of all races. With the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the country's immigration system was reformed and all national origin quotas were removed. Johnson was renowned for his domineering, sometimes abrasive, personality and the "Johnson treatment" – his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians in order to advance legislation.

Johnson infamously escalated American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1964, Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which granted Johnson the power to use military force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963,<ref>{{cite book|author=Russell H. Coward|title=A Voice from the Vietnam War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7bLU05TmGYC&pg=PA25|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood|page=25}}</ref> to 550,000 in early 1968, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|antiwar movement]] based especially on university campuses in the U.S. and abroad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Barbara|title=Political Protest and Cultural Revolution: Nonviolent Direct Action in the 1970s and 1980s|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vYW67obBjSEC&pg=PA41|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|page=41|isbn=978-0520914469}}</ref>

Johnson faced further troubles when summer riots broke out in most major cities after 1965, and crime rates soared, as his opponents raised demands for [[Law and order (politics)|"law and order"]] policies. While he began his presidency with widespread approval, support for Johnson declined as the public became further upset with both the war and the growing violence at home. The Democratic Party split in multiple feuding factions, and after Johnson did poorly in the 1968 New Hampshire primary, he ended his bid for reelection. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was elected to succeed him, as the [[New Deal coalition]] that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years collapsed. Johnson died four years after he left office. Historians argue that Johnson's presidency marked the peak of [[modern liberalism in the United States]] after the [[New Deal]] era. Johnson is ranked favorably by some historians because of his domestic policies.<ref name="histeval">{{cite web|last=Dallek |first=Robert |url=http://hnn.us/articles/439.html |title=Presidency: How Do Historians Evaluate the Administration of Lyndon Johnson? |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/president/Lyndon_Johnson.aspx |title=Survey of Presidential Leadership&nbsp;— Lyndon Johnson |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

==Early years==
[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson - 15-13-2 - ca. 1915.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lyndon Johnson – age 7]]
Lyndon Baines Johnson was born August 27, 1908 in [[Stonewall, Texas]], in a small [[farmhouse]] on the [[Pedernales River]], the oldest of five children. His parents, [[Samuel Ealy Johnson, Jr.]] (1877–1937) and Rebekah Baines (1881–1958), had three girls and two boys: Johnson and his brother, [[Sam Houston Johnson]] (1914–78), and sisters Rebekah (1910–78), Josefa (1912–61), and Lucia (1916–97). The nearby small town of [[Johnson City, Texas]], was named after LBJ's cousin, James Polk Johnson, whose forebears had moved west from Oglethorpe County, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Johnson had English, [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]], and German ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoover.archives.gov/exhibits/cottages/middleclass/johnson.html|title=Lyndon B. Johnson|publisher=The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> Johnson was maternally descended from a pioneer [[Baptist]] clergyman, [[George Washington Baines]], who pastored eight churches in Texas, as well as others in [[Arkansas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Baines, the grandfather of Johnson's mother, was also the president of [[Baylor University]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Johnson's grandfather, [[Samuel Ealy Johnson, Sr.]], was raised as a Baptist, and for a time was a member of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. In his later years the grandfather became a [[Christadelphians|Christadelphian]]; Johnson's father also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/Religion/religion_hm.asp|title=Religion and President Johnson|publisher=[[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Later, as a politician, Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather, had shared with him (see [[Operation Texas]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Banta |first=Joseph |title=President Lyndon B. Johnson |journal=The Christadelphian |volume=101 |page=26 |date=January 1964}}</ref> Johnson's favorite Bible verse came from the King James Version of Isaiah 1:18. "Come now, and let us reason together..."<ref>"Page 149 of "Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot" by Bill O'Reilly & Martin Dugard</ref>

In school, Johnson was an awkward, talkative youth and was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated from [[Lyndon B. Johnson High School (Johnson City, Texas)|Johnson City High School]] (1924), having participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball.<ref>{{cite book |title=Yearbook |editors=Patty Greenbaum, Lisa Lewis, Anne Drake, Zazel Loven |year=1990 |publisher=Dolphin |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-385-41625-2 |page=89}}</ref><ref name="Caro 1982">Caro 1982.</ref> At age 15, Johnson was the youngest member of his class. He was believed to have been the youngest graduate of the school. In the months following his graduation, Johnson relocated to California amidst pressure by his parents to go to college. Johnson enrolled in S.W.T.S.T.C. in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the twelve-grade courses needed for admission to Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos. Johnson would later say that he was kicked out of the school.<ref>Dallek 1991, p.57</ref>

In 1926, Johnson enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers' College (now [[Texas State University]]). He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper called [[University Star|''The College Star'']].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Student Editorials of Lyndon Baines Johnson |date=1968|publisher=LBJ Common Experience, Paper 1|url= http://ecommons.txstate.edu/lbjcomex/1|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican-American children at the segregated Welhausen School in [[Cotulla, Texas|Cotulla]], some {{convert|90|mi}} south of [[San Antonio]] in [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle County]]. The job helped him save money to complete his education, and he graduated in 1930. He then taught in Pearsall High School in [[Pearsall, Texas]], and afterwards took a position as teacher of public speaking at [[Sam Houston High School (Houston, Texas)|Sam Houston High School]] in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/biographys.hom/lbj_bio.asp|title=President Lyndon B. Johnson's Biography|publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> When he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], Johnson reminisced, "I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm|title=Remarks at Southwest Texas State College Upon Signing the Higher Education Act of 1965|publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|accessdate=April 11, 2006}}</ref>

==Early political career==
[[File:Richard Kleberg.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Johnson's boss, U.S. Rep. Richard Kleberg]]
After teaching in Houston Johnson entered politics; in 1930, he campaigned for Texas State Senator Welly Hopkins in his run for Congress. Hopkins recommended him to Congressman [[Richard M. Kleberg]], who made Johnson his legislative secretary. Johnson was elected speaker of the "Little Congress," a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. He also became a surrogate son to [[Sam Rayburn]].

Johnson later used an edited version of this photo, with Allred airbrushed out, in his 1941 senatorial campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caro|first=Robert|title=The Path to Power|at=Location 15443 (Kindle edition)}}</ref>]]
Johnson married [[Lady Bird Johnson|Claudia Alta Taylor]], also known as "Lady Bird", of [[Karnack, Texas]] on November 17, 1934, after he attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]] for several months. They had two daughters, [[Lynda Bird Johnson|Lynda Bird]], born in 1944, and [[Luci Baines Johnson|Luci Baines]], born in 1947. Johnson had a practice of giving people and animals names with his and his wife's initials, as he did with his daughters and with his dog, Little Beagle Johnson.<ref name="Inc1956">{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=John|title=A Kingmaker or a Dark Horse|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=70gEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA121|accessdate=July 20, 2010|date=June 25, 1956|journal=Life|pages=111–124}}</ref>

In 1935, he was appointed head of the Texas [[National Youth Administration]], which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss throughout his career, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends.<ref>Woods 2006, p. 131.</ref> He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control. As Johnson's biographer [[Robert Caro]] observes, "Johnson's ambition was uncommon—in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs."<ref>Caro 1982, p. 275.</ref>

==Congressional career==

===House of Representatives===
In 1937, Johnson successfully contested a special election for [[Texas's 10th congressional district]], that covered [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and the surrounding hill country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served in the House from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000160|title=JOHNSON, Lyndon Baines&nbsp;— Biographical Information|publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information, particularly with regard to issues concerning internal politics in Texas ([[Operation Texas]]) and the machinations of Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and [[Speaker of the House]] [[Sam Rayburn]]. Johnson was immediately appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Naval Affairs|Naval Affairs Committee]]. He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district. Johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew, such as the [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|Brown]] Brothers, Herman and George, who would finance much of Johnson's future career.<ref name="Caro 1982"/> In 1941, he ran for the U.S. Senate in a special election against the sitting [[Governor of Texas]], radio personality [[W. Lee O'Daniel|W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel]]; Johnson lost the election.

====War record====
[[File:Portrait of Lyndon B. Johnson in Navy Uniform - 42-3-7 - 03-1942.jpg|upright|thumb|Lt. Cdr. Johnson, March 1942]]
After America entered [[World War II]] in December 1941, Johnson, still in Congress, became a commissioned officer in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]], then asked Undersecretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] for a combat assignment.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hove, Duane T. |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-57249-307-0}}[http://www.americanwarriorsfivepresidents.com/]</ref> He was sent instead to inspect the shipyard facilities in Texas and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]]. Roosevelt felt information that flowed up the military chain of command needed to get delivered by a highly trusted political aide. From a suggestion by Forrestal, President Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team of the Southwest Pacific.<ref name="Dallek, Robert pp. 235">Dallek 1991, pp. 235–245.</ref>

Johnson reported to General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in Australia. Johnson and two Army officers went to the [[22nd Bomb Group (Red Raiders) 5th Army Air Force|22nd Bomb Group]] base, which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese [[airbase]] at [[Lae]] in [[New Guinea]]. A colonel took Johnson's allocated seat on one bomber, and it was shot down with no survivors. Reports vary on what happened to the [[B-26 Marauder]] carrying Johnson. He said it was also attacked by Japanese fighters but survived, while others, including other members of the flight crew, claim it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire; this is supported by official flight records.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |title= In-Depth Specials&nbsp;— The story behind Johnson's Silver Star |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613123509/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |archivedate = June 13, 2008}}</ref> Other airplanes that continued to the target ''did'' come under fire near the target at about the same time that Johnson's plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase. MacArthur awarded Johnson the [[Silver Star]], the military's third-highest medal.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Johnson reported to Roosevelt, to the Navy leaders and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable. He argued the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were "far inferior" to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a "critical" need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing "greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters." Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee.<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 235.</ref> With a mission similar to that of the [[Truman Committee]] in the Senate, he probed the peacetime "business as usual" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer, [[Robert Dallek]] concludes, "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men."<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 237.</ref>

===Senate===

====Contested 1948 election====
[[File:Senator Lyndon Johnson.jpg|upright|thumb|Lyndon B. Johnson as Senator from Texas]]
In the [[U.S. Senate election, 1948|1948 elections]], Johnson again ran for the Senate and won in a highly controversial result. In a three-way Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]] Johnson faced a well-known former governor, [[Coke Stevenson]], and a third candidate. Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter dubbed "The Johnson City Windmill". He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by voting for the [[Taft-Hartley]] act (curbing union power) as well as by criticizing unions. Stevenson came in first but lacked a majority, so a runoff was held; Johnson campaigned even harder, while Stevenson's efforts slumped.

The runoff count, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee (because this was a party primary) took a week; Johnson was finally announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295 cast. By a majority of one (29–28), the Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination, with the last vote cast on Johnson's behalf by [[Temple, Texas]], publisher [[Frank W. Mayborn]]. There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor [[John B. Connally]], was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in [[Jim Wells County, Texas|Jim Wells County]] that had curiously been cast in alphabetical order, just at the close of polling. Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day.<ref>Caro 1990, pp. 360–361.</ref> [[Robert Caro]] argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that 10,000 ballots were also rigged in [[Bexar County]] alone.<ref>Woods 2006, p. 217; Caro 1989.</ref> An election judge, Luis Salas, said in 1977, that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|url=}}</ref>
The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court, but—with timely help from his friend [[Abe Fortas]]—Johnson prevailed. He soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed "Landslide Lyndon,"; Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 346.</ref>

====Freshman senator to majority whip====
Once in the Senate, Johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful "courtships" of older senators, especially Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]], Democrat from Georgia, the leader of the [[Conservative coalition]] and arguably the most powerful man in the Senate. Johnson proceeded to gain Russell's favor in the same way that he had "courted" Speaker Sam Rayburn and gained his crucial support in the House.

Johnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and later in 1950, he helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. Johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. These investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration, although it can be said that the committee's investigations reinforced the need for changes. Johnson's brilliant handling of the press, the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports, and the fact that he ensured every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee all brought him headlines and national attention. Johnson used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in his wife's name.<ref name="'70s"/><ref name="new yorker">{{cite news|title=The Johnson Years: Buying And Selling|last=Caro|first=Robert A.|authorlink=Robert Caro|date=December 18, 1989|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/12/18/1989_12_18_043_TNY_CARDS_000356927}}</ref> After the 1950 general elections, Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader, [[Ernest McFarland]] of [[Arizona]], and served from 1951 to 1953.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

====Senate Democratic leader====
[[File:DemSenateLeadersDesk.jpg|thumb|Senate Desk X, used by all Democratic leaders, including Johnson, since [[Joseph Taylor Robinson]]]]
In the [[United States Senate election, 1952|1952 general election]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] won a majority in both the House and Senate. Among defeated Democrats that year was McFarland, who lost to upstart Barry Goldwater. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the minority leader; he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in appointment to a committee, while retaining it for chairmanships. In the [[United States Senate election, 1954|1954 election]], Johnson was re-elected to the Senate, and since the Democrats won the majority in the Senate, Johnson then became majority leader. Former majority leader [[William Knowland]] became minority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, Johnson suffered a near-fatal heart attack on July 2, 1955. He abruptly gave up smoking as a result, with only a couple of exceptions, and did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20, 1969. During the [[Suez Crisis]], Johnson supported the Anglo-French military attempt to topple the Egyptian president Colonel [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], and tried to prevent the US government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula. Along with the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], which established the civilian space agency [[NASA]].

Historians Caro and Dallek consider Lyndon Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was "the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known", discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote.<ref>Woods 2006, p. 262.</ref> Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/lbj_05.html#v230|title=LBJ|work=American Experience|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> Central to Johnson's control was "The Treatment",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterimagegallery.com/nytjohnson.htm |title=New York Times, The Johnson Treatment: Lyndon B. Johnson and Theodore F. Green |publisher=Afterimagegallery.com |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> described by two journalists:
:The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself&nbsp;— wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.
:Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Rowland Evans|first=Rowland|last=Evans|authorlink2=Robert Novak|first2=Robert|last2=Novak|title=Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise of Power|year=1966|page=104}}</ref>

==Vice Presidency==

===Nomination===
{{See also|United States presidential election, 1960}}
Johnson's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; he had been the "[[favorite son]]" candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956, and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. Jim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it better to wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy.<ref>Dallek 1991, pp. 544–545.</ref> Johnson's late entry into the campaign in July 1960, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing "Landslide Lyndon".<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 560.</ref> Caro opines that Johnson's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure.<ref>Caro 2012, Part I (passim).</ref>

Johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy's youth, poor health and failure to take a position regarding Joseph McCarthy.<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 570.</ref> After the failure of the "Stop Kennedy" coalition he had formed with [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], [[Stuart Symington]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]], Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy. [[Tip O'Neill]], then a representative from Kennedy's home state of [[Massachusetts]], recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, "Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot." O'Neill replied, "Senator, there's not going to be any second ballot."<ref>{{cite book|title=Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century: A Biography|author=John A. Farrell|year=2001|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0-316-26049-5}}</ref>

In regard to Johnson's nomination as the vice-presidential candidate, it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which the nomination ultimately took place - this according to Kennedy's Special Counsel [[Myer Feldman]] as well as Kennedy himself. Kennedy did realize he could not be elected without support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. After much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter, the morning after he was nominated, Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;am on July 14 and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, the facts are in many respects quite in dispute. (Convention Chairman Leroy Collins' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed.)<ref>Dallek 1991, pp. 578–582.</ref>

Seymour Hersh revealed that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] hated Johnson for his attacks on the Kennedy family, and therefore later maintained his brother offered the position to Johnson merely as a courtesy, expecting him to decline. [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] also concurred with Robert Kennedy's version of events, and alleged that John Kennedy would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]] but Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] and pressured Kennedy to favor Johnson.<ref>Seymour M. Hersh, ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12.</ref>

Biographer Robert Caro offered a different perspective; he wrote that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|election]] against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;am John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes "including Texas".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.">Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.</ref> Robert called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him; realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied "yes".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/> Caro contends it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting; he also called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role. According to Caro, Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were anti–Johnson. Kennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters including northern political bosses. O'Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson—apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization.<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/>

Caro continues in his analysis, that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate; he met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought "it was a stroke of genius".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/> When John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr|Joe Kennedy]], he told them signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest thing they had ever done.<ref>Caro 2012, p. 142.</ref>

At the same time as his Vice Presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro, "On November 8, 1960, Lyndon Johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and for a third term as Senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961."<ref>Caro 2002, p. 1035.</ref> (In 1988, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], the Vice Presidential running mate of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Michael Dukakis]], and also a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from Texas, took advantage of "Lyndon's law," and was able to retain his seat in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] despite Dukakis' loss to [[George H. W. Bush]].)

Johnson was re-elected Senator with 1,306,605 votes (58&nbsp;percent) to Republican [[John Tower]]'s 927,653 (41.1&nbsp;percent). Fellow Democrat [[William A. Blakley]] was appointed to replace Johnson as Senator, but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.

===Office===
[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to a ceremony]]
After the election, Johnson was quite concerned about the traditional feckless nature of his new office, and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members he had counted as his supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/lyndon_johnson.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States – Lyndon B. Johnson (1963)|format=pdf|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref>

Johnson sought to increase his influence within the Executive Branch; he drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson "general supervision" over matters of national security and requiring all government agencies to "cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments." Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to "review" national security policies instead.<ref>Caro 2012, p. 170–171.</ref> Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office, and to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House.<ref>Caro 2012, p. 172.</ref> His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend [[Sarah T. Hughes]] to a federal judgeship; whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency, [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.

Moreover, many members of the Kennedy White House, including the president's brother and [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] Robert F. Kennedy, were contemptuous of Johnson and ridiculed his comparatively brusque, crude manner. Congressman Tip O'Neill recalled that the Kennedy men "had a disdain for Johnson that they didn't even try to hide....They actually took pride in snubbing him."<ref>O, Neill, Tip. ''Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill'' (Random House, 1987), p. 182.</ref>

[[File:Opening Day of 1961 Baseball Season. President Kennedy throws out first ball. (first row) Vice President Johnson... - NARA - 194197.jpg|thumb|240px|Opening Day of 1961 Baseball Season. President Kennedy throws out first ball.]]
Kennedy, however, made efforts to keep Johnson busy, informed, and at the White House often, telling aides "I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy."<ref>Caro 2012, p. 176.</ref> Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Though Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position, [[Taylor Branch]] in ''Pillar of Fire'' contends that Johnson served to push the Kennedy administration's actions for civil rights further and faster than Kennedy originally intended to go. Branch notes the irony of Johnson, who the Kennedy family hoped would appeal to conservative southern voters, being the advocate for [[civil rights]]. In particular he notes Johnson's [[Memorial Day]] 1963 speech at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] as being a catalyst that led to more action.
Johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions, which gave him limited insights into global issues, as well as opportunities at self-promotion in the name of showing the country's flag. He was allowed to observe Cabinet and [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.15.</ref>

Kennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics Space Council]]. When, in April 1961, the Soviets beat the US with [[Vostok 1|the first manned spaceflight]], Kennedy tasked Johnson with evaluating the state of the US space program, and recommending a project that would allow the US to catch up or beat the Soviets.<ref>Kennedy to Johnson, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo1.pdf "Memorandum for Vice President,"] April 20, 1961.</ref> Johnson responded with a recommendation that the US gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a [[Apollo program|project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s]].<ref name="lbjmemo">Johnson to Kennedy, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf "Evaluation of Space Program,"] April 28, 1961.</ref><ref>Ben Evans, ''Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies'' (2010) p. 193.</ref> While Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, Johnson's appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.16.</ref>

Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when [[Bobby Baker]], the Senate Majority Secretary and a protégé of Johnson's, came under investigation by the [[Senate Rules Committee]] for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation stopped from expanding to Johnson. The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election. However, when a reporter asked on October 31, 1963, if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year, Kennedy replied, "Yes to both those questions."<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0811F93A541A7B93C1AB178AD95F478685F9 "Kennedy Denied Talk of Dropping Johnson"].

===Swift succession===
Johnson was quickly sworn in as President on ''[[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]]'' at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in Dallas on November 22, 1963, just two hours and eight minutes after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy was assassinated]] in Dallas, amid suspicions of a conspiracy against the government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/Lyndon-B.-Johnson-Sworn-in/12386108698633-4/ |title=JFK Assassination Coverage – Part 2: Lyndon B. Johnson Sworn in |publisher=UPI |date=November 22, 1963 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> He was sworn in by U.S. District Judge [[Sarah T. Hughes]], a family friend, making him the first (and so far only) President sworn in by a woman. He is also the only President to have been sworn in on Texas soil. In the rush, a bible was not at hand, so Johnson took the oath of office using a Roman Catholic [[missal]] from Kennedy's desk.<ref>Transcript, Lawrence F. O'Brien Oral History Interview XIII, 9/10/86, by Michael L. Gillette, Internet Copy, Johnson Library.

He and the secret service, concerned that he as well could be a target of a conspiracy, felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington. Naturally, this was greeted by some with assertions of Johnson being in too much haste to assume power.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 49–51</ref>

In the days following the assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson made an address to Congress: "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/|title=1963 Year In Review – Transition to Johnson |publisher=UPI |date=November 19, 1966 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's programs.

One week after the assassination, on November 29, Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center|Apollo Launch Operations Center]] and the NASA/Air Force [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral launch facilities]] as the ''John F. Kennedy Space Center''.<ref>{{cite web |title= The National Archives, Lyndon B.

Johnson was alert to the public demand for answers.  To head off snowballing speculation about conspiracies, he immediately created a panel headed by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], known as the [[Warren Commission]], to investigate the assassination.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 51</ref> The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in the assassination. Conspiracy theorists were not satisfied and kept active for decades.<ref>Robert D. Chapman, "The Kennedy Assassination 50 Years Later." ''International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence'' (2014) 27#3 pp: 615-619.</ref>

Johnson retained senior Kennedy appointees, some for the full term of his presidency, including the late President's brother, [[Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], with whom Johnson had a notoriously difficult relationship; Robert remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964, to run for the Senate.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 58.</ref> Johnson did bring in personal staff; although Johnson had no official Chief of Staff, [[Walter Jenkins]] was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. [[George Reedy]] who was Johnson's second longest serving aid and assumed the post of Press Secretary when JFK's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 66.</ref> Horace Busby was another "triple threat man" as Johnson referred to his aides. He served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 67.</ref> [[Bill Moyers]] was the youngest and in many ways the most extraordinary number of Johnson's staff. He handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 68.</ref>

===Rapid legislative initiatives===
The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals – a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with [[Harry F. Byrd, Sr.|Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 73–74.</ref> In late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his [[War on Poverty]], recruiting Kennedy relative [[Sargent Shriver]], then head of the [[Peace Corps]], to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, LBJ sent to Congress the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which created the [[Job Corps]] and the [[Community Action Program]], designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created [[VISTA]], Volunteers in Service to America, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 76–80.</ref>

===Civil rights===
[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|Johnson with Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and other [[Civil Rights]] leaders in 1964]]
President Kennedy had submitted a civil-rights bill to congress in June 1963, which was met with strong opposition.<ref>Reeves 1993, pp. 521–523</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|year=1965, 2002|title=A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House|page=973}}</ref> Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.115</ref> Historian [[Robert Caro]] notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p459</ref> In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/>

Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against the civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/> In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/> Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.<ref name="Caro, Robert p460">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p460</ref>

Passing the civil rights bill in the house required getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a [[discharge petition]] to force it onto the house floor.<ref name="Caro, Robert p462">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p462</ref> Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full house, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.116.</ref> In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the [[filibuster]] as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill.<ref>Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p463</ref> According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader [[Everett Dirksen]] to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the senate by a vote of 71–29.<ref>Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p465</ref><ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645">{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur Jr.|year=1978, 2002|title=Robert Kennedy And His Times|pages=644–645}}</ref> Johnson signed the fortified [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law on July 2.<ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645"/> Legend has it that as he put down his pen Johnson told an aide, "We have lost the South for a generation", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.120.</ref>

===The Great Society===
Johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965. Eric Goldman who joined the White House in December thought Johnson's domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman's book, ''The Good Society''. Richard Goodwin tweaked it – to "[[The Great Society]]" and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the University of Michigan. It encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-proverty, healthcare reform, crime control and educational reform.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.81–82.</ref>

===Gulf of Tonkin Resolution===
In August 1964 allegations arose from the military that two US destroyers had been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters 40 miles from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin; naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory. Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the Vietnamese, so he sought and obtained from the Congress the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] on August 7. Johnson, determined to embolden his image on foreign policy, also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action; a response to the purported attack as well blunted presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp. The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of [[SEATO]] requesting assistance. Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary US goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any US offensive posture.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 144-155</ref> The public's reaction to the resolution at the time was positive – 48% favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14% wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.157</ref> Retrospectively, the resolution was based on an incorrect assumption of North Vietnamese aggression, according to Johnson's later admission.<ref>{{cite news|title=LBJ tape 'confirms Vietnam war error|first=Martin|last=Fletcher|newspaper=The Times|date=November 7, 2001}}</ref>

===1964 presidential election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1964}}

In the spring of 1964 Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected as president in his own right.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 127.</ref> A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 124–126.</ref>

In 1964 Robert Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson' vice-president; but Johnson and Kennedy had never liked one another, and Johnson, fearful that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.135-137.</ref> Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater’s poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have on Kennedy as running mate.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.140-142.</ref> Hubert Humphrey’s selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.157.</ref> Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty; and, having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation, and coverage.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.157–59.</ref>

In preparation for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor. The squad's focus narrowed upon the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] ("MFDP") delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad’s activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the [[SNCC]] and [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]]. From beginning to end the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities which might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.161–163.</ref>
[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|right|325px|1964 Presidential election results]]
In fact Johnson was very concerned about the potential damage to the party's ticket from media coverage of potential racial tensions caused by the MFDP, and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.164.</ref> The convention’s Credentials Committee ultimately solved the problem through an agreement that placed  two MFDP delegates in the delegation and agreed to "bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color." With this problem solved, the convention became the personal triumph which Johnson craved.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.165</ref>

Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position, as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the "[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy ad]]". It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a [[Common Daisy|daisy]], counting up to ten. Then a baritone voice took over, counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of nuclear war. Goldwater’s campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming, “In your heart you know he's right.". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers saying “In your heart you know he might” and “In your gut you know he's nuts".<ref>Dallek 1998, p.170.</ref> Johnson won the presidency by a landslide, with 61.05&nbsp;percent of the vote, the highest ever [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|share of the popular vote]].<ref>Leip, David. ''[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]''</ref> At the time this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century&nbsp; – more than 15.95&nbsp;million votes – this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]]).<ref>Dallek 1998, p.182.</ref> Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936 – a Senate with a 68 to 32 majority and a house with a 295 to 140 Democratic margin.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.184.</ref>

===Voting Rights Act===
Johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office, ready to "carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1964/New-Moscow-Khrushchev-Fired/|title=1964 Year In Review – New Moscow: Khrushchev Fired|publisher=UPI|date=November 19, 1966}}</ref> Johnson was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; he suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the civil rights campaign in Selma Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately lead Johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.215.</ref>

Johnson gave a congressional speech – Dallek considers it his greatest – in which he said "rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself…rarely are we met with the challenge… to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation."<ref>Dallek 1998, p.218.</ref> In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill, the [[Voting Rights Act]], which outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. In accordance with the act, several states, "seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" – Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia&nbsp;— were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965, while Texas, home to the majority of the African American population at the time, followed in 1975.<ref name="Davidson, C. 1994 p. 3">Davidson, C. & Grofman, B. (1994). ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact Of The Voting Right Act, 1965–1990''. p. 3, Princeton University Press.</ref> The Senate passed the voting rights bill after just 2 1/2 months, by a vote of 77 to 19, and it won passage in the house in July, by 333 to 85. The results were significant – between 1968 and 1980 the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally – a few hundred black officeholders in 1965 mushroomed to 6000 in 1989.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.218.</ref>

After the murder of civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]], Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a "hooded society of bigots," and warned them to "return to a decent society before it's too late." Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] about 93 years earlier.<ref>President Grant, on October 17, 1871 suspended [[Habeas Corpus]] in 9 [[South Carolina]] counties, sent in troops, and prosecuted the Klan in the federal district court. McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 369–371.</ref> He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South.<ref>Woods 2006, pp. 759–787.</ref> At the [[Howard University]] commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals, "To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice, but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong&nbsp;— great wrong&nbsp;— to the children of God...''<ref>Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1965.'' Volume II, entry 301, pp. 635–640 (1966)</ref>

In 1967, Johnson nominated civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to be the first African American [[Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the Supreme Court. To head the new [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Johnson appointed [[Robert C. Weaver]]—the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration. In 1968 Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 [[Chicago Freedom Movement|Chicago Open Housing Movement]], the April 4, 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King,&nbsp;Jr.]], and the [[King assassination riots|civil unrest]] across the country following King's death.<ref name=Kotz05>{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days : Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King,&nbsp;Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-618-08825-3|page=417|chapter=14.

===Immigration===
With the passage of the sweeping [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the country's immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed.  The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Mexico.<ref name="'70s"/> Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities;  he had supported the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarren-Walters Act]] of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Mitchell B.|title=A Companion to Lyndon B. Johnson|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kxkcKYMWEcEC&pg=PA211|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages=211–17}}</ref>

===Federal funding for education===
Johnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was an essential component of the [[American dream]], especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes.<ref>Bernstein 1996, pp. 183–213.</ref> He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion.;<ref>Dallek 1988, pp. 195–198.</ref> with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was an historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before.<ref>Dallek 1988, pp. 200–201.</ref>

For the first time, large amounts of federal money went to public schools. In practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities).<ref>Bernstein 1996, p. 195.</ref> For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12&nbsp;percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by [[Hugh Davis Graham]] soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.

He set up the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], to support humanists and artists (as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] once did). Although ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam.<ref>Woods 2006, pp. 563–68; Dallek 1988, pp. 196–202.</ref> In 1967, Johnson signed the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|Public Broadcasting Act]] to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks.

==="War on Poverty" and healthcare reform===
[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Medicare bill, with Harry Truman, July 30, 1965.jpg|thumb|Truman and wife Bess at Medicare Bill signing]]

In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1964]] and the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]], as part of the [[war on poverty]]. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[food stamps]] and [[Federal Work-Study Program|Work Study]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/751/769950/Documents_Library/eoa1964.htm|title=Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|first=G. David|last=Garson|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref> During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23% to 12%.<ref name="histeval"/>

Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71% of the nation's deaths in 1962.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 204</ref> To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered down version.

As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 205.</ref> The key player in initiating this program, named [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], was [[Wilbur Mills]], Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake – hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as [[Medicaid]].<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 208.</ref> The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 209.</ref> Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714214416/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2000pres/20000712.html|title=Medicare Celebrates 35 Years of Keeping Americans Healthy|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref> Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President [[Harry S Truman]] and his wife [[Bess Truman|Bess]] after signing the Medicare bill at the [[Truman Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]].<ref>Patricia P.

===Gun control and the space program===
On October 22, 1968, Lyndon Johnson signed the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], one of the largest and farthest-reaching federal gun control laws in American history. Much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]].

During Johnson's administration, [[NASA]] conducted the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] manned space program, developed the [[Saturn V]] rocket and [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|its launch facility]], and prepared to make the first manned [[Apollo program]] flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]] was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator [[James E. Webb]]'s request for NASA to do its own investigation, holding itself accountable to Congress and the President.<ref>{{cite web |title=James E. Webb – NASA Administrator, February 14, 1961 – October 7, 1968 |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html| publisher= NASA| work=History.NASA.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425115407/http://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009}}</ref> Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two manned missions, [[Apollo 7]] and the first manned flight to the Moon, [[Apollo 8]], were completed by the end of Johnson's term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, "You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/lj36.html|title=Lyndon B.

===Urban riots===
[[File:Leffler -1968 WashingtonDC MLK riots.jpg|thumb|Aftermath from a race riot in Washington D.C., April 1968]]
Major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of "long hot summers." They started with a violent disturbance in [[Harlem Riot of 1964|Harlem riots]] in 1964, and the [[Watts Riots|Watts district]] of Los Angeles in 1965, and extended to 1971. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965, with the riots in Watts. After 34 lives were lost, along with $35 million in property damage, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite was lost for additional programs in LBJ's agenda.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 222-223.</ref> 

The biggest wave of riots came April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. [[1967 Newark riots|Newark burned]] in 1967, where six days of rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In [[12th Street riot|Detroit in 1967]], Governor [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] sent in 7400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party.<ref>Woods, Randall (2006), pp. 790–795; Michael W. Flamm. ''Law And Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s'' (2005).</ref> Johnson created the [[Kerner Commission]] to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Otto Kerner]].<ref name="'70s"/> According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off."<ref name=Kotz05>{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days : Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-618-08825-3|page=418|chapter=14.

===Backlash against Johnson: 1966–67===
[[File:Marcos visit Johnson 1966.jpg|thumb|Lyndon and [[Lady Bird Johnson]] with [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]] on September 12, 1966]]
In 1966 the press sensed a "[[credibility gap]]" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.<ref name="american chronicle">{{cite news

By year's end, the Democratic governor of [[Missouri]], [[Warren E. Hearnes]], warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964. "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs" had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5% jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in [[interest rate]]s. Johnson asked for a temporary 6% surcharge in [[income tax]]es to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50%; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16%, from 25% four months before. He ran about even with Republican [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] in trial matchups that spring. Asked to explain why he was unpopular, Johnson responded, "I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people." Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to." He also blamed "the preachers, liberals and professors" who had turned against him.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 391–396; quotes on pp. 391 and 396.</ref>
In the [[United States House election, 1966|congressional elections of 1966]], the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the [[conservative coalition]] and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass any additional Great Society legislation. However, in the end Congress passed almost 96% of the administration's Great Society programs, which Johnson then signed into law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideainfanttoddler.org/pdf/AppA.pdf|title=The Impact of the Great Society Upon The Lives of Families and Young Children|publisher=Infant & Toddler Coordinators Association|date=August 2005|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

In October 1966, Johnson became the first serving U.S. president to visit Australia. His visit sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lbj-came-all-the-way--but-few-followed-20111111-1nbrg.html |title=LBJ came all the way - but few followed|last1=Humphries |first1=David |date=November 12, 2011 |website=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

===Vietnam War===
====1964–1965====
Johnson ascribed to the [[Domino Theory]] in Vietnam and to a [[containment]] policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion.<ref name="scholastic">{{cite news

Johnson in late summer 1964 questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but, after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor, declared his readiness “to do more when we had a base" or when Saigon was politically more stable.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 239.</ref> In the 1964 presidential campaign, he restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he had a sense of foreboding about Vietnam – a feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly. Indeed his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Vietcong attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa airbase in South Vietnam.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 240.</ref> Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 241.</ref> By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam. U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.<ref name="Vietnam War"/>
[[File:Robert S. McNamara and General Westmoreland in Vietnam 1965.png|thumb|right|Defense Secretary McNamara and General Westmoreland in Vietnam 1965]]
in the winter of 1964-65 Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists, with only 26 to 30% opposed.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 244.</ref> Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara, that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, “Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General Nguyen Khanh (head of the new government) is our boy".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 247.</ref>

Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat; also, the Vietcong had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at [[Pleiku Air Base]]. The eight week bombing campaign became known as [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear – there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 249.</ref> Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Vietcong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Vietcong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 250–252.</ref>

In March Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces – American air operations alone he counseled would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South. Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000, the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions – and most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; nevertheless, he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 255.</ref>

====1966–1968====
In early 1966 Johnson sent marines to the Dominican Republic to protect the embassy there and to respond to yet another perceived communist threat. That spring an agreement was reached at the urging of the OAS and the US to end the uprising; this crisis reinforced Johnson’s belief it was essential to convince supporters and opponents at home and abroad that he had an effective strategy to meet the communist challenge in Vietnam.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.265–268.</ref>

After a conference of advisors in Honolulu in April 1966, by the middle of June the total US ground forces in Vietnam were increased to 82,000 or by 150%.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.268.</ref> On May 2 1966 Johnson told congressional leaders that he wanted an additional $700 million for Vietnam and the Dominican Republic saying "each member of Congress who supports this request is voting to continue our effort to try to hold communist aggression". The request was approved by the House 408 to 7 and by the Senate 88 to 3.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.269.</ref> In June Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse.<ref>Dallek 1998, p.270.</ref>

By 1968, over 550,000 American soldiers were in Vietnam; during 1967 and 1968 they were being killed at the rate of 1,000 a month.<ref>{{cite book|author=United States.

Politically, Johnson closely watched the public opinion polls. His goal was not to adjust his policies to follow opinion, but rather to adjust opinion to support his policies. Until the [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968, he systematically downplayed the war; he made very few speeches about Vietnam, and held no rallies or parades or advertising campaigns. He feared that publicity would charge up the hawks who wanted victory, and weaken both his containment policy and his higher priorities in domestic issues. Jacobs and Shapiro conclude, "Although Johnson held a core of support for his position, the president was unable to move Americans who held hawkish and dovish positions." Polls showed that beginning in 1965, the public was consistently 40–50&nbsp;percent hawkish and 10–25&nbsp;percent dovish. Johnson's aides told him, "Both hawks and doves [are frustrated with the war] ... and take it out on you.".<ref>Lawrence R. Jacobs and Robert Y. Shapiro. "Lyndon Johnson, Vietnam, and Public Opinion: Rethinking Realist Theory of Leadership." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 29#3 (1999), p. 592.</ref>

Additionally, domestic issues were driving his polls down steadily from spring 1966 onward. A few analysts have theorized that "Vietnam had no independent impact on President Johnson's popularity at all after other effects, including a general overall downward trend in popularity, had been taken into account."<ref>{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Mueller|title=War, Presidents and Public Opinion|year=1973|page=108|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471623007}}</ref> The war grew less popular, and continued to split the Democratic Party. The Republican Party was not completely pro- or anti-war, and Nixon managed to get support from both groups by running on a reduction in troop levels with an eye toward eventually ending the campaign.

Johnson often privately cursed the [[Vietnam War]] and, in a conversation with [[Robert McNamara]], he assailed "the bunch of commies" running ''[[The New York Times]]'' for their articles against the war effort.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111701187.html|title=Tapes Reveal LBJ's Vietnam Conversations|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 1, 2013|first=Kelley|last=Shannon|date=November 18, 2006}}</ref> Johnson believed that America could not afford to lose and risk appearing weak in the eyes of the world. In a discussion about the war with former President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was "trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how" and later stated that he needed "all the help I can get."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |title=LBJ Library releases telephone conversation recordings |publisher=Lbjlib.utexas.edu |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611221222/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |archivedate = June 11, 2008}}</ref> Johnson escalated the war effort continuously from 1964 to 1968, and the number of American deaths rose. In two weeks in May 1968 alone American deaths numbered 1,800 with total casualties at 18,000. Alluding to the Domino Theory, he said, "If we allow Vietnam to fall, tomorrow we'll be fighting in Hawaii, and next week in San Francisco."

After the [[Tet Offensive]] of January 1968, his presidency was dominated by the Vietnam War more than ever. Following evening news broadcaster [[Walter Cronkite]]'s editorial report during the Tet Offensive that the war was unwinnable, Johnson is reported to have said, "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America."<ref>{{cite news | title=Broadcast News | url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/01/26/reviews/970126.26wickert.html |work=The New York Times |last=Wicker|first=Tom |date=January 26, 1997 | accessdate=May 1, 2009|authorlink=Tom Wicker}}</ref>

As casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] cards, and chanted, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"<ref name="scholastic"/> Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], where thousands of [[hippies]], [[yippies]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest.<ref>Frank Kusch, Battleground Chicago: The Police and the 1968 Democratic National Convention (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), p.62.</ref> Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the "hawks" rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the "doves" rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well known quotes was "the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best".<ref>Gould 2010, p. 98.</ref>

Perhaps Johnson, himself, best summed up his involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] as President:

{{cquote|I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucified either way I moved. If I left the woman I really loved—the [[Great Society]]—in order to get involved in that bitch of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at home. All my programs.... But if I left that war and let the Communists take over [[South Vietnam]], then I would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser and we would both find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere on the entire globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quotes.dictionary.com/i_knew_from_the_start_that_i_was|title=Quotation by Lyndon Baines Johnson|publisher=dictionary.com|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref>}}

Many political pundits and experts said that Johnson suffered "agonizing decisions" in foreign policy in the involvement in Vietnam and felt it caused divisions both in the U.S. and abroad.<ref>{{cite news|title=LBJ Gets [[House of Commons of Canada|Commons]] Tributes|date=January 24, 1973|author=Canadian Press|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|page=18}}</ref>

Johnson was afraid that if he tried to defeat the North Vietnamese regime with an invasion of North Vietnam, rather than simply try to protect South Vietnam, he might provoke the Chinese to stage a full-scale military intervention similar to their intervention in 1950 during the [[Korean War]], as well as provoke the Soviets into launching a full-scale military invasion of western Europe. It was not until the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s that it was finally confirmed that the Soviets had several thousand troops stationed in North Vietnam throughout the conflict, as did China.

===The Six Day War and Israel===
[[File:Glassboro-meeting1967.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson (right) next to Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] (left) during the [[Glassboro Summit Conference]]]]
In a 1993 interview for the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|Johnson Presidential Library]] oral history archives, Johnson's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that a [[carrier battle group]], the [[U.S. 6th Fleet]], sent on a training exercise toward [[Gibraltar]] was re-positioned back towards the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to be able to assist Israel during the [[Six Day War]] of June 1967. Given the rapid Israeli advances following their strike on Egypt, the administration "thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians, fearing Israel would attack them, or the Soviets supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel". The Soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move. In a [[Moscow–Washington hotline|hotline]] message from Moscow, Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] said, "If you want war you're going to get war."<ref name="oralhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/McNamaraR/McNamara-SP1.PDF|title=LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON LIBRARY ORAL HISTORY COLLECTION|publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|format=PDF|accessdate=October 8, 2005}}</ref>

===1968 presidential election===
[[File:Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon 1968.jpg|thumb|President Johnson meets with Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the White House, July 1968.]]
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1968}}
As he had served less than 24 months of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under the provisions of the [[22nd Amendment]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}</ref> Initially, no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic party. Only Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]] challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire]] [[primary election|primary]], hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42&nbsp;percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49&nbsp;percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in [[Wisconsin]], the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.

By this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party, which was splitting into four factions, each of which generally disliked the other three. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses (led by Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]). The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group were Catholics, Hispanics and African Americans, who rallied behind [[Robert Kennedy]]. The fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind [[George C. Wallace]] and the [[American Independent Party]]. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson could see no way to win the war<ref name="scholastic"/> and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election.<ref>Gould 2010.</ref>
[[File:US President Lyndon Johnson Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|right|300px|upright|Foreign trips of Lyndon Johnson during his presidency]]
In addition, although it was not made public at the time, Johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four-year term. Therefore, at the end of a March 31 speech, he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3388|title=Remarks on Decision not to Seek Re-Election (March 31, 1968)|publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36% to 49%.<ref name=Updegrove12>{{cite book|last=Updegrove|first=Mark K.|title=Indomitable will : LBJ in the presidency|year=2012|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-88771-9|edition=1st ed.|page=272}}</ref>

Historians have debated the factors that led to Johnson's surprise decision. Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeff Shesol|title=Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bVrRvYV7i78C&pg=PA545|year=1998|publisher=W W Norton |pages=545–47}}</ref> Gould says that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy strength until the very last minute, when it was too late for Johnson to recover.<ref>Gould 2010, pp. 16–18.</ref> Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Bennett Woods|title=LBJ: architect of American ambition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sb8W_Ba3jkkC&pg=PA834|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=834–35}}</ref> Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 518–525.</ref> Bennett, however, says Johnson, "had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony J. Bennett|title=The Race for the White House from Reagan to Clinton: Reforming Old Systems, Building New Coalitions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XH4Os4Cjr-cC&pg=PT160|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=160}}</ref>

Johnson did rally the party bosses and unions to give Humphrey the nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Personal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson Rockefeller's]] campaign. He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee, he would not campaign against him (and would not campaign for Humphrey).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Perlstein|title=[[Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America]]|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4302-5}}</ref> In what was termed the [[October surprise]], Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of "all air, naval and artillery bombardment of [[North Vietnam]]", effective November 1, should the [[Hanoi]] Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. In the end, Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey, enabling Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]] to win the election.

===Judicial appointments===
{{see also|Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointment controversies}}
[[File:Thurgood-marshall-2.jpg|thumb|200px|With the appointment of [[Thurgood Marshall]], Johnson placed the first African American on the Supreme Court.]]

====Supreme Court====
{{Main|Lyndon B. Johnson Supreme Court candidates}}
Johnson appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]:

* [[Abe Fortas]]–1965
* [[Thurgood Marshall]]–1967 (the first African-American)

Johnson in 1965 anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures, and thought it advantageous to have a "mole" in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldenberg accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the position. Only Johnson's insistence, as well as a slight of hand, in Fortas' assuming Goldberg's seat, could overcome Fortas' wife's objection, that it was too early in his career. Mrs. Fortas expressed unparalleled disapproval to Johnson personally afterwards.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp.233–235.</ref> When [[Earl Warren]] announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and nominated [[Homer Thornberry]] to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.

====Other courts====
{{Main|Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointments}}
In addition to his Supreme Court appointments, Johnson appointed 40 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 126 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Johnson also had a small number of [[Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]], with one appellate and three district court nominees not being confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] before Johnson's presidency ended.

===Scandals and controversies===
During 1973 testimony before Congress, the CEO of America's largest cooperative of milk producers said that while Johnson was President, his cooperative had leased Johnson's private jet at a "plush" price, which Johnson wanted to continue once he was out of office.<ref name="'70s"/>

In Latin America, Johnson directly and indirectly supported the overthrow of left-wing, [[Electoral democracy|democratically elected]] president [[Juan Bosch]] of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[João Goulart]] of [[Brazil]], maintaining US support for anti-communist, authoritarian Latin American regimes. American foreign policy towards Latin America remained largely static until election of [[Jimmy Carter]] to the presidency in 1977.

===Personality and public image===
[[File:LBJ National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|Johnson as he appears in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18–20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them."

Johnson's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country. From {{convert|250|acre}} of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a {{convert|2700|acre|adj=on}} working ranch with 400 head of registered Hereford cattle. The [[National Park Service]] keeps a herd of Hereford cattle descended from Johnson's registered herd and maintains the ranch property.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranching the LBJ Way|url=http://www.nps.gov/lyjo/planyourvisit/lbjranching.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson 1972.jpg|thumb|Johnson during an interview in August 1972, sporting longer hair]]
After leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speech writer [[Harry J. Middleton]], who would draft Johnson's first book, ''The Choices We Face,'' and work with him on his memoirs entitled ''The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969,'' published in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry J. Middleton Curriculum Vitae|date=February 25, 1971|agency=LBJ Presidential Library Reading Room}}</ref> That year, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] opened near the campus of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park]], with the provision that the ranch "remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Marvin |last=Harris |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/parksci/vol19/vol19(2)/08–1harris.htm |title=Taming the wild pecan at Lyndon B.

Johnson gave Nixon "high grades" in foreign policy, but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces too quickly, before the South Vietnamese were really able to defend themselves. "If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home," he warned.<ref name="theatlantic1973">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|date=July 1973|title=The Last Days of the President|last=Janos|first=Leo|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>

During the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], Johnson endorsed Democratic presidential nominee [[George S. McGovern]], a Senator from [[South Dakota]], although McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. The McGovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated "if only the Democrats don't go too far left," he had insisted. Johnson had felt [[Edmund Muskie]] would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson's protégé [[John Connally]] had served as President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head "[[Democrats for Nixon]]", a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashman|first=Charles R.|title=Connally: The Adventures of Big Bad John|year=1974|publisher=Morrow|location=New York|isbn=978-0688002220|page=271}}</ref>

[[File:LBJ At Ranch 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Johnson at his ranch in Texas, 1972]]
In March 1970, Johnson was hospitalized at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, after suffering an attack of [[angina]]. He was urged to lose considerable weight. He had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the White House, gaining more than {{convert|25|lb}} and weighing around {{convert|235|lb}}. He had also resumed smoking after nearly fifteen years without having done so, which contributed further to his health issues. The following summer, again gripped by chest pains, he embarked on a crash water diet, shedding about {{convert|15|lb}} in less than a month. In April 1972, Johnson experienced a massive heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Charlottesville, Virginia. "I'm hurting real bad," he confided to friends. The chest pains hit him nearly every afternoon – a series of sharp, jolting pains that left him scared and breathless. A portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air. He continued to smoke heavily, and, although placed on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only in fits and starts. Meanwhile, he began experiencing severe stomach pains. Doctors diagnosed this problem as [[diverticulosis]], pouches forming on the intestine. His condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended. Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. [[Michael DeBakey]], who decided that Johnson's heart condition presented too great a risk for any sort of surgery, including coronary bypass of two almost totally destroyed heart arteries.<ref name="theatlantic1973"/>

==Death and funeral==
{{Pull quote|float=right|width=32%|On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), Johnson saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, Johnson pulled out a cigarette—his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said, "Daddy, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself." He took it back and said, "I've now raised you girls. I've now been President. ''Now it's '''my''' time!''" From that point on, he went into a very self-destructive spiral.|author=Historian [[Michael Beschloss]].<ref>''Decisions That Shook the World'', vol. 1, 38:18–47. Dir. Gerald Rafshoon. Camera Planet/Discovery Productions, 2004.</ref>}}

Johnson died at his [[ranch]] at 3:39&nbsp;p.m. CST on January 22, 1973, at age 64 after suffering a massive heart attack. His death came the day before a ceasefire was signed in Vietnam and just a month after former President [[Harry S. Truman]] died. (Truman's funeral on December 28, 1972 had been one of Johnson's last public appearances). His death also occurred just two days after the end of what would have been his final term in office had he successfully won reelection in 1968.  His health had been affected by years of [[chain smoking|heavy]] [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], poor diet, and extreme stress; the former president had advanced [[coronary artery disease]]. He had his first, nearly fatal, heart attack in July 1955 and suffered a second one in April 1972, but had been unable to quit smoking after he left the Oval Office in 1969. He was found dead by Secret Service agents, in his bed, with a telephone receiver in his hand. The agents were responding to a desperate call Johnson had made to the Secret Service compound on his ranch minutes earlier complaining of "massive chest pains".<ref>''[[The Age]]'', January 23, 1973, p. 1.</ref>

Shortly after Johnson's death, his press secretary [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]] (no relation), telephoned [[Walter Cronkite]] at CBS; Cronkite was live on the air with the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' at the time, and a report on Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite was still on the line, so he could break the news.<ref>{{YouTube|id=zxHsSnEgk-A&fmt=18|title=Walter Cronkite announces the death of LBJ 1973}}</ref>
