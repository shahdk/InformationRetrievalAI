'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en|'|r|?|n|?l|d|_|'|w|?|l|s|?n|_|'|r|e?|g|?n}}; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American actor and politician. He was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th President of the United States]] (1981–89), and served as the [[List of Governors of California|33rd]] [[Governor of California]] (1967–75) prior to his presidency.

Born and raised in small towns in Illinois, Reagan graduated from [[Eureka College]] and then worked as a radio broadcaster. He moved to Hollywood in 1937, where he began a career as an actor, first in films and later in television.  Reagan served as President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and later as a spokesman for [[General Electric]] (G.E.); his start in politics occurred during his work for G.E.  Originally, he was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], but due to the parties' shifting platforms during the 1950s, he switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1962.<ref name="reagansheritage.org">[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003061647/http://www.reagansheritage.org/html/reagan_career_busch.shtml Ronald Reagan: The Heritage Foundation Remembers]. Reagansheritage.org. Retrieved July 15, 2013.</ref>

After delivering [[A Time for Choosing|a rousing speech]] in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|two years later]] and [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|again in 1970]]. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], but won both the nomination and general election in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], defeating incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="reagansheritage.org"/>

As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending. In his first term he also survived [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|an assassination attempt]], took a hard line against [[Labor unions in the United States|labor unions]], escalated the [[War on Drugs]], and ordered an [[invasion of Grenada]] to reverse a Communist coup.

He was re-elected in a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]], proclaiming that it was "[[Morning in America]]". His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 bombing of Libya]], and the revelation of the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an "[[evil empire]]",<ref>{{cite web|author=Gingrich, Newt|authorlink=Newt Gingrich|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/evil-empire|title=The Evil Empire|publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date=Spring–Summer 2008|volume=58|issue=4|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of [[détente]] in favor of [[rollback]] by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR. Reagan subsequently negotiated with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], culminating in the [[INF Treaty]] and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals. The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] occurred soon afterward.

Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier in the year; he [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died ten years later]] at the age of 93. A [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] icon, he ranks highly in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents]] and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American [[political right]].

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,<ref name="pk 16">Kengor, p. 16</ref> and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,<ref name="pk 16"/> which he was baptized into in 1922.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Lewis, Warren and Rollmann, Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=1-59752-416-6|pages=181–192}}</ref> For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination, and recalled a time in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]] when the local inn would not allow [[black people]] to stay there.

==Early political career==
Reagan began his political career as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and, in December 1945, was prevented from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Holly­wood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition to [[mutually assured destruction]], building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy. |publisher=Heritage.org |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}</ref> In the 1948 election, Reagan strongly supported [[Harry S.

Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27, 1964: "The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.

He defeated former [[San Francisco]] mayor [[George Christopher]] in the GOP primary.

Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential waters in 1968]] as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support<ref name="Stormy">*{{cite book|author=Fischer, Klaus|title=America in White, Black, and Gray: The Stormy 1960s|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1816-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sCXig_6abwkC&pg=PA241|pages=241–243}}</ref> and be a compromise candidate<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 1968|accessdate=October 16, 2007}}</ref> if neither Nixon nor second-place [[Nelson Rockefeller]] received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the [[1968 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]].

Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#May 15, 1969: "Bloody Thursday"|People's Park protests]] at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday", resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.<ref name="Cannon50"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|accessdate=December 9, 2007|date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> Reagan then called out 2,200 [[United States National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.<ref name="Cannon50">Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50.</ref> A year after "Bloody Thursday", Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with.

[[File:NIXONSandREAGANS.jpg|thumb|The Reagans meeting with then-President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] in July 1970]]
Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator [[Anthony Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act", in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50"/> The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51"/> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].<ref name="Cannon51"/> He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.<ref>Reagan, Ronald.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/13/local/me-history13 Recall Idea Got Its Start in L.A. in 1898], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 13, 2003</ref> Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" [[Jesse Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment, which he strongly supported.<ref name="Rest of Me"/> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin|San Quentin's]] gas chamber.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}</ref>

In 1969, Reagan, as Governor, signed the [[Family Law Act of 1969|''Family Law Act'']], an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the [[California state legislature]] for over two years<ref>Community Property and Family Law: The Family Law Act of 1969 by Aidan R.

Stats. chapter 1608, page 3313</ref>

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work", he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M}}</ref>

Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by Democratic [[California Secretary of State]] [[Jerry Brown]] on January 6, 1975.

==1976 presidential campaign==

[[File:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan on the podium with Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention after narrowly losing the presidential nomination.]]

In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]] which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R. Ford|publisher=The White House|accessdate=March 29, 2007}} Ford considered himself a "a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs".</ref>

Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]] of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as<ref>{{Cite news|date=September 24, 1979|accessdate=May 10, 2008|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html}}</ref> he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.<ref name="1976 Results">{{cite web|url=http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006023552/http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archivedate=October 6, 2006|title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, February 24, 1976 Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}</ref> The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all ninety-six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including [[Ernest Angelo]], the mayor of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Ray Barnhart]] of [[Houston]], whom President Reagan would appoint in 1981 as director of the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hathorn Billy|year =2010|title =Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96–0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976|journal=[[West Texas Historical Association]] Yearbook|volume =86|pages =77–91 }}</ref>

However, as the GOP [[1976 Republican National Convention|convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of Pennsylvania as his [[running mate]] if nominated.

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union.

Reagan launched his campaign by declaring "I believe in states' rights."  After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his primary opponents, [[George H.W.

Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 50.7% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and Independent [[John B.

Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of "[[peace through strength]]" resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.<ref name="apsr">{{Cite journal|author=Bartels, Larry M.|title=Constituency Opinion and Congressional Policy Making: The Reagan Defense Build Up|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=June 1, 1991|volume=85|issue=2|pages=457–474|doi=10.2307/1963169|issn=0003-0554|first=L.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the [[U.S. intelligence community]] to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nation-wide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy", had it terminated.<ref>{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

A formal appeal from the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St.&nbsp;George's University as adequate reasons to invade.

Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned.

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol Rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[Winter 1985 Arctic outbreak|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}</ref><ref name="nytimes.com"/>

In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves "victims", a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of [[the Holocaust]]; [[Pat Buchanan]], Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat|authorlink =Pat Buchanan|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|archivedate =September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,<ref>Reeves, p. 249</ref> the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]], part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.<ref name=iokp;>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | title= Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 23, 1982|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref> These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque]], resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman. Stating that there was "irrefutable proof" that Libya had directed the "terrorist bombing", Reagan authorized the use of force against the country.

By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm |title=A/RES/41/38 November 20, 1986 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}</ref>

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html|title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}</ref> Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society.

President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot's existence. He appointed two Republicans and one Democrat ([[John Tower]], [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Edmund Muskie]], known as the "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal.

==Legacy==
[[File:Ronald Reagan with cowboy hat 12-0071M edit.jpg|thumb|Ronald Reagan in 1976 at his home at [[Rancho del Cielo]]]]
Since Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among scholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reaganomics,<ref>Hayward, pp. 635–38</ref> foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War after Reagan's eight years in office,<ref>Beschloss, p. 324</ref> and a restoration of American pride and morale.<ref name="cannon746"/> It is also said that Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/02/rollins.reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan restored faith in America|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref> following a decline in American confidence and self-respect after [[Jimmy Carter]]'s perceived weak leadership, particularly during the [[Iranian hostage crisis]], as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook for the future of the United States during the 1980 election.<ref>[http://www.planethan.com/drupal/sites/default/files/The%20Decline%20of%20Confidence%20in%20American%20Institutions%20%20By%20Lipset%20Seymour%20Martin%20and%20Schneider%20William%20Political%20Science%20Quarterly%20Fall83%20Vol%2098%20Issue%203%20p379.pdf]</ref> Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits,<ref name="Cannon128"/> a wider [[Wealth inequality in the United States|gap in wealth]], and an increase in [[homelessness]]<ref name="DreierNation">[http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2011/042011/04032011/605895/printer_friendly Don't add Reagan's Face to Mount Rushmore] by Dr. Peter Dreier, ''[[The Nation]]'', April 3, 2011</ref> and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilman, Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref>

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], President of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."<ref>{{cite web|author=Feulner, Edwin J., PhD|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"<ref>{{cite web|author=Weisbrot, Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}</ref>

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication, dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|title=American President|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref> Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,<ref>David Henry in ''Journal of American History'' December 2009 v. 96#3 p. 934</ref> as summarized by British historian [[Michael J. Heale|M. J. Heale]], who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in [[American exceptionalism]], and contributed to victory in the Cold War.<ref>Heale, M.J. in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds.
