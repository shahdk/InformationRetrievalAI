'''Martin Van Buren''' (December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|eighth]] [[President of the United States]] (1837&ndash;1841). Before his presidency, he was the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|eighth]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1833–1837) and the tenth [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] (1829–1831), both under [[Andrew Jackson]].

Van Buren was a key organizer of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], a dominant figure in the [[Second Party System]], and the first president not of [[British Americans|British]] or [[Irish Americans|Irish]] descent—his family was [[Dutch American|Dutch]]. He was the first president to have been [[Natural born citizen of the United States|born a United States citizen]],<ref>[http://www.hoover.nara.gov/exhibits/cottages/middleclass/vanburen.html NARA.gov], Martin Van Buren</ref> since all of his predecessors were born [[British subjects]] before the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwhitehouse.org/prespgs/mvanburen.html |title=Martin Van Buren |publisher=Ourwhitehouse.org |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> He is the first president not to have spoken English as a first language, having spoken only [[Dutch language|Dutch]] growing up.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sturgis|first=Amy H.|authorlink=Amy Sturgis|title=The Trail of Tears and Indian Removal|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|page=93|isbn=0-313-33658-X}}</ref> Van Buren was also the first president from the state of [[New York]].

As [[Andrew Jackson]]'s Secretary of State and then Vice President, Van Buren was a key figure in building the organizational structure for [[Jacksonian democracy]], particularly in New York. As president, he did not want the United States to annex [[Texas]], an act which [[John Tyler]] would achieve eight years after Van Buren's initial rejection. Between the bloodless [[Aroostook War]] and the [[Caroline affair|''Caroline'' Affair]], relations with Britain and its colonies in [[Canada]] also proved to be strained.

His administration was largely characterized by the economic hardship of his time, the [[Panic of 1837]]. He was scapegoated for the depression and called "Martin Van Ruin" by political opponents. Van Buren was voted out of office after four years, losing to [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[William Henry Harrison]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 election]] Van Buren ran unsuccessfully for president on a third-party ticket, the [[Free Soil Party]]. Van Buren died fourteen years later at the age of seventy-nine.

[[File:MVBBirth.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze marker with a map of the State of New York at the top, under which is the word Birth site and other text|[[Historical marker]] located at the birthplace of Martin Van Buren.]]
Martin Van Buren was born in the village of [[Kinderhook (village), New York|Kinderhook, New York]], on December 5, 1782, about 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) south of [[Albany, New York]]. His father, Abraham Van Buren (1737–1817), was a farmer who owned six slaves, and also owned and operated a tavern and inn in Kinderhook. Abraham Van Buren supported the American Revolution and later the Jeffersonian Republicans. Martin Van Buren's mother was Maria Hoes Van Alen Van Buren (1747–1818).<ref>Martin's mother had been married to Johannes Van Alen; he died and left her with three children. In 1776, she married Abraham Van Buren. By his mother's first marriage, Van Buren had one half-sister and two half-brothers, including [[James I. Van Alen]], who practiced law with Van Buren for a time and served as a Federalist member of Congress (1807–1809). Van Buren had four full siblings from his parents' marriage: Dirckie "Derike" Van Buren (1777–1865); Jannetje "Hannah" Van Buren (1780-?); Lawrence Van Buren (1786–1868), who served as an officer in the New York militia during the War of 1812 and later was active in the Barnburners New York Democrats; and Abraham Van Buren (1788–1836).</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Navarro |first= Bob |date= 2006 |title= The Era of Change: Executives and Events in a Period of Rapid Expansion |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=eXTvt4q00zAC&pg=PA75&dq=Maria+Hoes+Van+Alen+Van+Buren&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pjQwVKeIOYbgsAS11oGoAw&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Maria%20Hoes%20Van%20Alen%20Van%20Buren&f=false |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |page= 75}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= 2010 |title= Columbia Rising: Civil Life on the Upper Hudson from the Revolution to the Age of Jackson |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L0XxrMd4nEsC&pg=PA481&dq=%22abraham+van+buren%22+kinderhook+revolution&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FjYwVNDHApPGsQSev4GACQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20van%20buren%22%20kinderhook%20revolution&f=false |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |page= 481}}</ref>

Van Buren was the first president born a citizen of the [[United States]], as all previous presidents were born before the American Revolution. His great-great-great-grandfather Cornelis Maessen van Buren had come to the Americas in 1631 from Buurmalsen, today a village in the municipality of [[Geldermalsen]]. Buurmalsen is localized nearby the small city of [[Buren]], [[Dutch Republic]], in present day [[Netherlands]]. Van Buren grew up in a Dutch-speaking community. His native language was [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and to date, he is the only U.S. President who has spoken [[American English|English]] as [[List of Presidents of the United States by languages spoken|a second language]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Widmer|first=Edward|title=Martin Van Buren|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2005|isbn=0-8050-6922-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YiU_kd-iAcgC&printsec=frontcover&q=|accessdate=21 March 2010|authorlink=Edward L. Widmer|page=ii}}</ref>

Van Buren received a basic education at a poorly lit schoolhouse in his native village and later studied [[Latin]] briefly at the [[Kinderhook Academy]] and at [[Washington Seminary]] in Claverack.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9YlBAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s Gazetteer and business directory of Columbia County, N.Y. for 1871-2] (Printed at the Journal office, 1871) pp. 106–108</ref> He excelled in composition and speaking. His formal education ended before he reached 14, when he began [[Reading law|studying law]] at the office of [[Peter Silvester (1734–1808)|Peter Silvester]] and his son Francis, prominent [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] attorneys in Kinderhook.<ref>{{cite book |last= Brooke |first= John L. |date= 2010 |title= Columbia Rising: Civil Life on the Upper Hudson from the Revolution to the Age of Jackson |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=L0XxrMd4nEsC&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+studied+law+%22peter+silvester%22&source=bl&ots=cNjrg50J-m&sig=NF3QKR0zrSA37M7wzmFzO_-HfN0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L19OVISWGYTJgwSE2YCAAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20studied%20law%20%22peter%20silvester%22&f=false |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |page= 230}}</ref> After six years under the Silvesters, he spent a final year of apprenticeship in the [[New York City]] office of [[William P.

==Early political career==
Van Buren had been active in politics from at least the age of 17 when he attended a party convention in [[Troy, New York]] where he worked to secure the Congressional nomination for [[John Peter Van Ness]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Brooke |first= John L. |date= 2010 |title= Columbia Rising: Civil Life on the Upper Hudson from the Revolution to the Age of Jackson |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=L0XxrMd4nEsC&pg=PA283&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+convention+congressional+nomination+%22van+ness%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U0RKVN_jE5PGgwSXioCICA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20convention%20congressional%20nomination%20%22van%20ness%22&f=false |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |page= 283}}</ref> He formed a law partnership with his half-brother [[James I. Van Alen]], and once established in his practice, he became wealthy enough to increase his focus on politics.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mackenzie |first= William Lyon |date= 1846 |title= The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=hXssAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA21&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+law+partner+%22van+alen%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EEVKVKfpIdHJgwSlqILoDQ&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20law%20partner%20%22van%20alen%22&f=false |publisher= Cooke & Co. |pages= 21-22}}</ref> He was an early supporter of [[Aaron Burr]], and allied himself with the [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton faction]] of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. Van Buren supported [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] for Governor over incumbent [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in 1807.  Tompkins won, and his allies were a majority in the state legislature. As a result, Van Buren was appointed [[Probate court|Surrogate]] of [[Columbia County, New York]], replacing Van Alen, who had supported Lewis. Van Buren served as Surrogate from 1808 until 1813, when the [[Federalist Party]] obtained a majority in the state legislature and replaced him.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wilson |first= James Grant |date= 1898 |title= The Presidents of the United States 1789-1897 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qeY2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA169&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+surrogate+%22van+alen%22+lewis+tompkins&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZjdKVM_kLvSMsQTet4KYDg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20surrogate%20%22van%20alen%22%20lewis%20tompkins&f=false |publisher= D.

Van Buren was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1812 to 1820, and joined the [[Bucktails|opposition party]] in 1813.  (The opposition party were Democratic-Republicans who fought [[DeWitt Clinton]] for control of the Democratic-Republican Party in New York.)  Van Buren served as [[New York Attorney General]] from 1815 to 1819. He replaced [[William Floyd]] as a [[presidential elector]] in [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820]], and voted for [[James Monroe]] and [[Daniel D. Tompkins]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Weed |first= Thurlow |last2= Parsons |first2= John D. |date= 1879 |title= Civil List and Forms of Government of the Colony and State of New York |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=iD1DAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA240&dq=%22new+york%22+presidential+electors+1820&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QUZKVJnNA43IggSWmYLADQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=presidential%20electors&f=false |publisher= Weed, Parsons & Co. |page= 345}}</ref>

At first he opposed DeWitt Clinton's plan for the [[Erie Canal]], but he supported it when the [[Bucktails]] (the name given to the anti-DeWitt Clinton Democratic-Republicans) were able to gain a majority on the [[Erie Canal Commission]], and he supported a bill that raised money for the canal through the sale of state bonds.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nowlan |first= Robert A. |date= 2012 |title= The American Presidents, Washington to Tyler: What They Did, What They Said, What Was Said About Them, with Full Source Notes |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=MlNWU1e9ppUC&pg=PA315&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+%22erie+canal%22+state+bonds&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mkdKVLv9N8uPNqiZgeAO&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20%22erie%20canal%22%20state%20bonds&f=false |publisher= McFarland Publishing |page= 315}}</ref>

In 1817, Van Buren's connection with so-called "machine politics" started. He was a creator of the first political organization encompassing all of New York, the Bucktails.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Van Buren|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/martinvanburen|accessdate=25 July 2013|work=[[The White House]]}}</ref> The Bucktails became a successful movement that emphasized party loyalty and used it to capture and control many patronage posts throughout New York. Van Buren gained the nickname of "Little Magician" for the skill with which he exploited what came to be called the "[[spoils system]]". Van Buren served as a member of the 1820 state [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], where he favored expanded voting rights, but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property requirements for voting.<ref>{{cite book |last= Keyssar |first= Alexander |date= 2000 |title= The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=UijIgQP0xF8C&pg=PA55&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+opposed+universal+suffrage&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gEhKVLKbPM27ggTvyoDgAQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20opposed%20universal%20suffrage&f=false |publisher= Basic Books |page= 55}}</ref>

He was the leading figure in the [[Albany Regency]], a group of Bucktail leaders who for more than a generation dominated the politics of New York and influenced national politics. The Regency, together with other political organizations such as [[Tammany Hall]], played a major role in expanding the spoils system and making it a recognized and accepted  procedure. He was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party: the [[Jacksonian Democrats]]  or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which evolved from the Democratic-Republicans and relied on party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious sectional issues, including tariffs and slavery, from becoming national crises. In Van Buren's words, "Without strong national political organizations, there would be nothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states."<ref>"Martin Van Buren", pp. 103–114</ref>

[[File:MVanBuren.png|thumb|right|300px|Gubernatorial [[portrait]] of Martin Van Buren.]]
In [[United States Senate election in New York, 1821|February 1821]], Martin Van Buren was elected a [[U.S. Senator from New York]], defeating the incumbent [[Nathan Sanford]] who ran as the [[DeWitt Clinton|Clintonian]] candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dodd |first= William Edward |date= 1899 |title= American Statesmen: Martin Van Buren |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=kwE7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA487&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+defeat+sanford+senate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ynRKVMuvAc_HgwTt_4LgBg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20defeat%20sanford%20senate&f=false |publisher= Houghton, Mifflin & Co. |page= 76}}</ref> Van Buren at first favored [[internal improvements]], such as road repairs and canal creation, therefore proposing a constitutional amendment in 1824 to authorize such undertakings. The next year, however, he took ground against them. He voted for the [[tariff in American history|tariffs]] of 1824 and 1828, and then gradually abandoned the protectionist position, coming out for "tariffs for revenue only."<ref>{{cite book |last= Holland |first= William M. |date= 1836 |title= The Life and Political Opinions of Martin Van Buren |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2s1cI5uNNZQC&pg=PA269&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+tariff+1824&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oXNKVLnmA8rygwTmvYH4BQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20tariff%201824&f=false |publisher= Belknap & Hammersley |pages= 269-273}}</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], Van Buren supported [[William H. Crawford]] and received the electoral vote of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]].

Van Buren had originally hoped to block [[John Quincy Adams]] by denying him the state of New York, which was divided between supporters of Crawford and Adams. However, Representative [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]] swung New York to Adams and thereby the election.<ref>{{cite book |last= Krabbendam |first= Hans, editor |date= 2009 |title= Four Centuries of Dutch-American Relations: 1609-2009 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=BsFFWlQ8RwEC&pg=PA251&dq=%22van+rensselaer%22+adams+%22new+york%22+president+1824&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k3ZKVJalL8voggTotYCwDw&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22van%20rensselaer%22%20adams%20%22new%20york%22%20president%201824&f=false |publisher= State University of New York Press |page= 251}}</ref> After the House contest, Van Buren shrewdly kept out of the controversy which followed, and began looking forward to 1828.

Since Democrats, especially Southerners, were generally opposed to tariffs that increased the price of manufactured goods from the North but did not benefit the raw materials produced in the South, Van Buren could normally have been expected to oppose tariffs.  Political observers of the time viewed Van Buren's efforts to pass the 1828 tariff as part of the campaign to elect Jackson as President.  Anticipating that most Southerners would vote for Andrew Jackson no matter who else was running, Van Buren intended the tariff proposed by Jackson's Northern Democratic supporters in Congress to attract to Jackson's candidacy Northern voters, who generally favored high tariffs to protect the manufactured goods they produced.  Van Buren voted in favor, later adopting the cover story that he had done so only in response to instructions from the [[New York State Legislature]].  Most Democrats, especially Southerners, continued to oppose tariffs after 1828.  Van Buren's political opponents in the Democratic Party used his 1828 vote against him for years afterwards to prevent him from obtaining Southern support for his candidacies.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ayers |first= William L. |date= 2009 |title= American Passages: A History of the United States |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=SbXS5-4QGAUC&pg=PA284&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+tariff+1828&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5NVOVKHCJbDgsAT3toKgDQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20tariff%201828&f=false |publisher= Wadsworth Cengage Learning |page= 284}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Richter |first= William L. |date= 2006 |title= The A to Z of the Old South |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=-VTh1AIqB5EC&pg=PA335&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+tariff+1828&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5NVOVKHCJbDgsAT3toKgDQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20tariff%201828&f=false |publisher= Scarecrow Press |page= 335}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Force |first= Peter |date= 1840 |title= The Northern Man With Southern Principles, and the Southern Man With American Principles: Gen.

Van Buren was not an orator, but his more important speeches show careful preparation and his opinions carried weight; the oft-repeated charge that he refrained from declaring himself on crucial questions is hardly borne out by an examination of his senatorial career. In [[United States Senate election in New York, 1827|February 1827]], he was re-elected to the Senate by a large majority. He became one of the recognized managers of the Jackson campaign, and his tour of [[Virginia]], the [[Carolinas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the spring of 1827 won support for Jackson from Crawford. Martin Van Buren sought to reorganize and unify "the old Republican party" behind Jackson.<ref>Martin Van Buren to [[Thomas Ritchie]], January 13, 1827.</ref> At the state level, Jackson's committee chairs would split up the responsibilities around the state and organize volunteers at the local level. "Hurra Boys" would plant hickory trees (in honor of Jackson's nickname, "Old Hickory") or hand out hickory sticks at rallies. Van Buren even had a New York journalist write a campaign piece portraying Jackson as a humble, pious man. "Organization is the secret of victory," an editor in the Adams camp wrote. He once said to a group of lobbyists the famous quote and "By the want of it we have been overthrown." In 1828 Van Buren ran for [[Governor of New York]] in an effort to use his personal popularity to bolster Jackson's chances of carrying New York in the presidential election.  Van Buren and Jackson both won, and Van Buren resigned his Senate seat to start the gubernatorial term which began on January 1, 1829.<ref>{{cite book |last= Benjamin |first= Gerald |date= 2012 |title= The Oxford Handbook of New York State Government and Politics |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=l3AnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA322&dq=%22martin+van+buren%22+term+governor+january+1829&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ky9QVP-eBo7asATy3oL4CA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20buren%22%20term%20governor%20january%201829&f=false |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 322}}</ref>

Martin Van Buren's tenure as New York governor is the second shortest on record. While his term was short, he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law (an early form of deposit insurance) through the Legislature.<ref>{{cite book |last= Neu |first= Irene D. |date= 1960 |title= Erastus Corning: Merchant and Financier, 1794-1872 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=jEDlH_ryLw4C&pg=PA91&dq=%22van+buren%22+bank+safety+fund+law&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2DJQVMaPPKrdsAS11oLoBQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22van%20buren%22%20bank%20safety%20fund%20law&f=false |publisher= Cornell University Press  |page= 91}}</ref>

==Jackson Cabinet==
On March 5, 1829, President Jackson appointed Van Buren [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], an office which probably had been assured to him before the election, and Van Buren resigned the governorship on March 12.<ref>[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA183 ''The Annals of Albany''] published by Joel Munsell (Albany, 1855; p. 183)</ref> He was succeeded in the governorship by his Lieutenant Governor, [[Enos T. Throop]], a member of the Regency. As Secretary of State, Van Buren took care to keep on good terms with the [[Kitchen Cabinet]], the group of politicians who acted as Jackson's advisers.  He sometimes opposed Jackson in the matter of removing political appointees from office to replace them with Jackson loyalists, but also saw to the replacement of Postmasters in New York with Van Buren loyalists.<ref>{{cite book |last= Cole |first= Donald B. |date= 1984 |title= Martin Van Buren and the American Political System |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=vqz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&dq=%22van+buren%22+jackson+spoilsman&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0DNQVMi9FuWIsQSl8IGoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22van%20buren%22%20jackson%20spoilsman&f=false |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= 195}}</ref>

He won the lasting regard of Jackson by his courtesies to [[Peggy Eaton]], wife of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John H. Eaton]], with whom the wives of the cabinet officers led by Vice President Calhoun's wife, [[Floride Calhoun]] had refused to associate in the [[Petticoat Affair]]. Aside from the Petticoat Affair, he skillfully avoided entanglement in the Jackson-[[John C. Calhoun|Calhoun]] imbroglio.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

[[File:The rejected Minister.jpg|thumb|alt=Cartoon image of an older man riding on the back of another older man and stumbling toward the steps of a building labeled "Capitol"|1832 Whig cartoon shows [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]] carrying Van Buren into office]]
No diplomatic questions of the first magnitude arose during Van Buren's service as secretary, but the settlement of long-standing claims against France was prepared and trade with the [[British West Indies]] colonies was opened. In the controversy with the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], he sided with Jackson. After the breach between Jackson and Calhoun, Van Buren was clearly the most prominent candidate for the vice-presidency.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

===Vice-Presidency===
In December 1829, Jackson had already made known his wish that Van Buren receive the nomination.<ref>Meacham, Jon, American Lion, Random House (2008), p. 308</ref> In April 1831, Van Buren resigned as Secretary of State as a result of the [[Petticoat affair]]—though he did not leave office until June. Van Buren still played a part in the [[Kitchen Cabinet]].<ref>[http://reference.aol.com/columbia/_a/kitchen-cabinet/20051206185809990009 AOL.com], Kitchen Cabinet, [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]</ref> In August 1831 Van Buren was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Court of St. James (Britain)]] and he arrived in London in September. He was cordially received, but in February, he learned that his nomination had been rejected by the Senate on January 25, 1832. The rejection, ostensibly attributed in large part to Van Buren's instructions to [[Louis McLane]], the American minister to Britain, regarding the opening of the West Indies trade, in which reference had been made to the results of the election of 1828, was the work of [[John C. Calhoun|Calhoun]], the vice-president. When the vote was taken, enough of the majority refrained from voting to produce a tie and give Calhoun his longed-for "vengeance." No greater impetus than this could have been given to Van Buren's candidacy for the vice-presidency.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

After a brief tour through Europe, Van Buren reached New York on July 5, 1832. The [[1832 Democratic National Convention]], the party's first and held in May, had nominated him for vice-president on the Jackson ticket, despite the strong opposition to him which existed in many states. Van Buren's platform included supporting the expansion of the naval system. His declarations during the campaign were vague regarding the tariff and unfavorable to the United States Bank and to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], but he had already somewhat placated the South by denying the right of Congress to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] without the consent of the slave states.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

==Election of 1836==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1836}}
It took Van Buren and his partisan friends a decade and a half to form the Democratic Party; many elements, such as the national convention, were borrowed from other parties.<ref>Holt (2003) 998</ref>

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1832|election of 1832]], the Jackson-Van Buren ticket won by a landslide. When the election of 1836 came up, Jackson was determined to make Van Buren, his personal choice, President to continue his legacy. Martin Van Buren's only competitors in the 1836 election were the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], who ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation would have one vote. [[William Henry Harrison]] hoped to receive the support of the Western voters, [[Daniel Webster]] had strength in New England, and [[Hugh Lawson White]] had support in the South. Van Buren was [[unanimity|unanimously]] nominated by the [[1835 Democratic National Convention]] at [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. He expressed himself plainly on the questions of slavery and the bank at the same time voting, perhaps with a touch of bravado, for a bill offered in 1836 to subject [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] literature in the mails to the laws of the several states. Van Buren's [[United States presidential election, 1836|presidential victory]] represented a broader victory for Jackson and the party. Van Buren entered the White House as a fifty-four-year-old widower with four sons. Martin Van Buren was the first candidate to use grassroots campaigning in his presidential campaign.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He wanted to make a political party that united the plain republicans of the north and the planters of the south.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Twentieth Century etymologist [[Allen Walker Read]] published research asserting the wide usage of the phrase "O.K." ([[okay]]) -- "'''O'''ld '''K'''inderhook"—started during the presidential campaign and subsequent presidency of Martin Van Buren.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Martin Van Buren announced his intention "to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor", and retained all but one of Jackson's cabinet. Van Buren had few economic tools to deal with the [[Panic of 1837]]. The Panic was followed by a five-year [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. Banks failed and [[unemployment]] reached record highs.<ref>W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&pg=PA210&dq=PA349&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''". Rowman & Littlefield. p.210. ISBN 0742511898</ref> Some modern economists have argued that the Panic was caused by the bank policies of the Jackson administration, with the power to create money being distributed into decentralized banks, most of which would then continue to cause a massive inflationary bubble.<ref>{{cite web |title=Age of Jackson: Crash Course US History #14 |work=CrashCourse  |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beN4qE-e5O8 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Van Buren advocated lower tariffs and free trade, and by doing so maintained support of the South for the Democratic Party. He succeeded in setting up a system of bonds for the national debt. His party was so split that his 1837 proposal for an "Independent Treasury" system did not pass until 1840. It gave the Treasury control of all federal funds and had a legal tender clause that required (by 1843) all payments to be made in [[Coin|specie]], but it further inflamed public opinion on both sides.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In a bold step, Van Buren reversed Andrew Jackson's policies and sought peace at home, as well as abroad. Instead of settling a financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican government by force, Van Buren wanted to seek a diplomatic solution. In August 1837, Van Buren denied [[Texas]]' formal request to join the United States, again prioritizing sectional harmony over territorial expansion.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In the case of the ship ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'', Van Buren sided with the [[Spanish Government]] to return the kidnapped slaves. Van Buren oversaw the movement of [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], [[Chickasaw]] and [[Seminole]] tribes from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alabama]], and [[South Carolina]] to the [[Oklahoma territory]], executing the orders passed under Jackson. To help secure [[Florida]], Van Buren also continued the [[Second Seminole War]], which had begun while Jackson was in office. Fighting was not resolved until 1842, after Van Buren had left office.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In 1839, [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] visited Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help roughly 20,000 Mormon settlers of [[Independence, Missouri]], who were forced from the state during the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] there. The Governor of Missouri, [[Lilburn Boggs]], had issued [[Missouri Executive Order 44|an executive order]] on October 27, 1838, known as the "Extermination Order". It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to "exterminate or drive [them] from the state".<ref>{{cite web |title=Extermination Order |work=LDS FAQ |url=http://ldsfaq.byu.edu/emmain.asp?number=74 |accessdate=22 August 2005}}</ref><ref>Boggs, Extermination Order</ref> In 1839, after moving to Illinois, Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, "Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph Fielding |authorlink=Joseph Fielding Smith |title=Church History and Modern Revelation |volume=4 |pages=167–173 |publisher=Deseret |date=1946–1949}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Ann Eliza Young, John Bartholomew Gough, Mary Ashton Rice Livermore |title=Wife no. 19, or, the story of a life of bondage |page=55 |year=1876 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5URCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q}}</ref>

Van Buren took the blame for hard times, as Whigs ridiculed him as ''Martin Van Ruin.'' Van Buren's rather elegant personal style was also an easy target for Whig attacks, such as the [[Gold Spoon Oration]]. State elections of 1837 and 1838 were disastrous for the Democrats, and the partial economic recovery in 1838 was offset by a second commercial crisis in that year. Nevertheless, Van Buren controlled his party and was unanimously renominated by the Democrats in 1840. The revolt against Democratic rule led to the [[United States presidential election, 1840|election]] of [[William Henry Harrison]], the [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] candidate. He once mentioned his relief of leaving office saying, "As to the presidency, the two happiest days of my life were those of my entrance upon the office and my surrender of it".{{cn|date=October 2014}}

On the expiration of his term, Van Buren returned to his estate, [[Lindenwald]] in Kinderhook, where he planned out his return to the White House. He seemed to have the advantage for the nomination in 1844; his famous letter of April 27, 1844, in which he frankly opposed the immediate annexation of [[Texas]], though doubtlessly contributing greatly to his defeat, was not made public until he felt practically sure of the nomination. In the Democratic convention, though he had a majority of the votes, he did not have the two-thirds which the convention required, and after eight ballots his name was withdrawn. [[James K. Polk]] received the nomination instead.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In 1848, he was nominated by two minor parties, first by the "[[Barnburner]]" faction of the Democrats, then by the [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]], with whom the "Barnburners" coalesced. He won no electoral votes, but took enough votes in New York to give the state—and perhaps the election—to [[Zachary Taylor]]. In the election of 1860, he voted for the [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] ticket in New York which was opposed to [[Abraham Lincoln]], but he could not approve of [[James Buchanan|President Buchanan's]] course in dealing with secession and eventually supported Lincoln.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Martin Van Buren then retired to his home in Kinderhook. After being bedridden with a case of pneumonia during the fall of 1861, Martin Van Buren died of bronchial [[asthma]] and [[heart failure]] at his Lindenwald estate in Kinderhook at 2:00 a.m. on July 24, 1862. He was 79 years old. He is buried in the Kinderhook Cemetery along with his wife Hannah, his parents, and his son Martin Van Buren, Jr.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lamb, Brian & the C-SPAN staff |title=Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?: A Tour of Presidential Gravesites |location=Washington, DC |publisher=NationaL Cable Satellite Corporation |year=2000 |isbn=1-881846-07-5}}</ref> A [[cenotaph]] to him is located near the parking lot of the [[Reformed Dutch Church (Kinderhook, New York)|

===Locations===
* [[Van Buren County, Michigan]], is named after him. It was so named in 1829 while Van Buren was Secretary of State. This was done in hopes of winning support in the Jackson administration for [[Michigan]]'s bid to become a state. Van Buren County is one of several [[cabinet counties|counties]] named after Jackson or members of his cabinet for this reason.
* [[Van Buren, Arkansas]] is named after him. Formerly known as Phillips Landing, a Post Office established in 1831 was called Van Buren after the Secretary of State.
* The town of [[Van Buren, Missouri]] was founded in 1833, when Martin Van Buren was Vice President of the US.

===In popular culture===
* Martin Van Buren was portrayed by [[Nigel Hawthorne]] in the [[1997 in film|1997]] [[list of historical drama films#Films set in the 18th and 19th centuries|historical drama film]] [[Amistad (film)|''Amistad'']].<ref>{{IMDb title|0118607|Amistad}}</ref>
* In [[Seinfeld]], the episode [[The Van Buren Boys]] is focused on a gang based on the president.
* In an early scene of the film "[[Two Faces of January]]", the main characters - American expatriates in [[Athens]] - encounter an American tourist girl and discover that she is a Van Buren. They then argue if Martin Van Buren had been the seventh or the eighth President.
